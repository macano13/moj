00:00:01,851 --> 00:00:03,218
A stranger has come to Kattegat.

3
00:00:03,219 --> 00:00:04,920
He takes away Ivar's pain.

4
00:00:04,921 --> 00:00:08,257
If he possesses powers,
then he is putting them to good use.

5
00:00:08,258 --> 00:00:09,558
But are you sure?

6
00:00:09,559 --> 00:00:12,027
I wanted something
to happen between you and me.

7
00:00:12,028 --> 00:00:13,811
It was wrong of me. I'm married.

8
00:00:14,230 --> 00:00:16,899
The Northmen are fighting beside us

9
00:00:16,900 --> 00:00:19,001
to help us gain the throne of Mercia,

10
00:00:19,002 --> 00:00:21,336
for our puppet, Princess Kwenthrith.

11
00:00:21,337 --> 00:00:22,337
Spare my brother.

12
00:00:27,510 --> 00:00:28,644
Porunn!

14
00:00:31,748 --> 00:00:32,948
It is ended!

15
00:00:32,949 --> 00:00:35,284
How many more of us must
die for your Christians?

16
00:00:35,285 --> 00:00:37,002
This is your fault.

17
00:00:37,003 --> 00:00:38,737
What have the gods told you?

18
00:00:38,738 --> 00:00:40,389
What have you foreseen?

19
00:00:40,390 --> 00:00:42,290
No one can help you.

Ivar, what is it?

22
00:01:50,660 --> 00:01:52,159
Where is Harbard?

23
00:01:52,495 --> 00:01:53,662
I don't know.

24
00:01:53,663 --> 00:01:55,263
You have to find him.

25
00:01:55,264 --> 00:01:57,648
Ivar is suffering so badly.
I can't bear it!

26
00:01:58,368 --> 00:01:59,968
Why can't you look after your own child?

27
00:02:02,689 --> 00:02:03,689
I am here.

28
00:02:12,432 --> 00:02:13,781
Ivar.

29
00:02:14,083 --> 00:02:17,219
There is no more pain, Ivar.

30
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:20,389
No. No more pain.

31
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:22,024
That's right.

32
00:02:22,025 --> 00:02:24,258
Very sleepy, Ivar.

33
00:02:28,164 --> 00:02:30,398
You're getting very sleepy.

34
00:02:31,050 --> 00:02:33,401
There's no more pain.

35
00:02:35,705 --> 00:02:37,071
Go to sleep.

36
00:02:49,152 --> 00:02:50,668
Who are you?

37
00:02:51,170 --> 00:02:53,587
- You know who I am.
- No, I don't.

38
00:02:54,991 --> 00:02:56,590
You have such power.

39
00:02:59,028 --> 00:03:00,411
Are you a god?

40
00:03:00,863 --> 00:03:02,129
I wish.

41
00:03:03,149 --> 00:03:05,332
For who would not wish for such a thing?

42
00:04:08,998 --> 00:04:10,297
Porunn.

So much for Rollo, the warrior.

53

The hammer to the cross.

54
00:05:26,008 --> 00:05:27,258
Where is your soul?

55
00:05:28,611 --> 00:05:30,010
Where is your belief?

56
00:05:31,881 --> 00:05:33,314
Floki, forget it.

57
00:05:33,749 --> 00:05:34,749
This...

58
00:05:35,585 --> 00:05:36,884
This is the future.

59
00:05:38,588 --> 00:05:40,254
We cannot fight everyone.

60
00:05:40,890 --> 00:05:42,439
There must be cooperation,

61
00:05:42,859 --> 00:05:45,626
alliances just as there
are among the gods.

62
00:05:47,396 --> 00:05:48,829
That is the way forward.

63
00:05:49,498 --> 00:05:51,182
Well, well.

64
00:05:51,183 --> 00:05:54,735
It seems that the magic of your
Christian baptism has worked after all.

65
00:05:55,204 --> 00:05:58,439
You said the whole thing was a joke.
Perhaps you took it seriously.

66
00:05:59,976 --> 00:06:01,810
You know very well it was a joke.

67
00:06:01,811 --> 00:06:03,211
No.

68
00:06:03,212 --> 00:06:06,097
I can see that you have all
drunk from the poisoned chalice!

69
00:06:06,098 --> 00:06:08,782
And the joke, Rollo, is on you!

70
00:06:23,316 --> 00:06:24,899
I see you are still suffering.

71
00:06:27,954 --> 00:06:29,270
I can make it better.

72
00:06:30,439 --> 00:06:31,439
How?

73
00:06:33,976 --> 00:06:34,976
Lie back.

74
00:06:44,420 --> 00:06:45,886
What are you doing?

75
00:07:10,613 --> 00:07:12,713
I suppose I should thank you.

76
00:07:14,550 --> 00:07:16,250
I suppose that maybe you should.

77
00:07:17,086 --> 00:07:18,769
I may have just saved your life.

78
00:07:23,426 --> 00:07:24,959
Your brother is weak.

79
00:07:27,530 --> 00:07:28,862
He is just a puppet.

80
00:07:31,033 --> 00:07:33,067
And he will be your downfall.

81
00:07:37,907 --> 00:07:39,874
I know what you think about Ecbert.

82
00:07:39,875 --> 00:07:41,175
Do you believe him?

83
00:07:42,278 --> 00:07:43,278
Should I not?

84
00:07:44,146 --> 00:07:46,748
He has always acted
in his own interests.

85
00:07:46,749 --> 00:07:49,250
He wants power over me and over Mercia.

86
00:07:49,251 --> 00:07:50,684
I did not fight for him.

87
00:07:52,621 --> 00:07:54,488
I fought for my people,

88
00:07:56,759 --> 00:07:57,858
and for you.

89
00:08:03,766 --> 00:08:05,015
How is your wound?

90
00:08:07,403 --> 00:08:08,887
It still hurts.

91
00:08:13,876 --> 00:08:15,376
Do you need to lie back?

92
00:08:28,107 --> 00:08:29,223
Wait!

93
00:08:31,577 --> 00:08:33,978
- Where are you going?
- Out.

94
00:08:33,979 --> 00:08:36,548
- Where? With whom?
- It is not your concern.

95
00:08:36,549 --> 00:08:37,749
Oh, it is my concern,

96
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:40,134
since you are once again
leaving your children behind.

97
00:08:40,770 --> 00:08:42,437
I know they will be safe with you.

98
00:08:42,438 --> 00:08:43,837
Are you going with him?

99
00:08:44,573 --> 00:08:46,975
Just look after my children,
it's all I ask.

100
00:08:46,976 --> 00:08:48,175
No.

101
00:08:48,377 --> 00:08:51,745
- What are you trying to do?
- I am trying to save you.

102
00:08:53,549 --> 00:08:55,350
It is not just the children.

103
00:08:55,351 --> 00:08:57,585
You have other responsibilities.

104
00:08:57,586 --> 00:08:59,421
Ragnar has left Kattegat in your care.

105
00:08:59,422 --> 00:09:00,972
There are folk
who are waiting to see you.

106
00:09:00,973 --> 00:09:03,157
There are important matters to decide.

107
00:09:03,726 --> 00:09:05,860
Let go of your queen.

108
00:09:05,861 --> 00:09:07,027
Then I will do it.

109
00:09:08,964 --> 00:09:10,764
I will accept the responsibility.

110
00:09:20,776 --> 00:09:23,511
I heard a story
about a king who was killed

111
00:09:23,512 --> 00:09:26,281
and all his family massacred.

112
00:09:26,282 --> 00:09:28,183
But his wife, Astrid,

113
00:09:28,184 --> 00:09:31,118
she escaped and fled to
an island in the middle of a lake.

114
00:09:31,687 --> 00:09:33,921
I was smuggled onto the island,

115
00:09:35,391 --> 00:09:37,491
and I was introduced to Astrid.

116
00:09:38,494 --> 00:09:41,729
She was the most beautiful
woman I had ever seen.

117
00:09:41,730 --> 00:09:43,831
And she was a nymphomaniac.

118
00:09:44,333 --> 00:09:47,468
She needed a lot of sex.

119
00:09:50,656 --> 00:09:52,639
I was forced to sleep with her.

120
00:09:53,309 --> 00:09:54,475
Forced?

121
00:09:55,327 --> 00:09:58,712
I heard later that nine months
after I left the island,

122
00:09:59,048 --> 00:10:02,232
she gave birth to a
second son called Olaf.

123
00:10:03,285 --> 00:10:08,021
Now this Olaf is Grand Duke
of Kiev and all Russia.

124
00:10:08,390 --> 00:10:09,923
And he is your son?

125
00:10:10,843 --> 00:10:12,292
I am sure of it.

126
00:10:14,997 --> 00:10:16,964
I am forever in your debt.

127
00:10:17,299 --> 00:10:19,467
What you have done for my son is...

128
00:10:19,468 --> 00:10:22,369
Is what I would do for
any suffering creature.

129
00:10:24,373 --> 00:10:25,539
Like you.

130
00:10:26,342 --> 00:10:27,908
Me?

131
00:10:28,544 --> 00:10:30,077
I am not suffering.

132
00:10:30,446 --> 00:10:31,446
Yes.

133
00:10:32,047 --> 00:10:35,149
Your husband is a long way away,

134
00:10:35,718 --> 00:10:38,619
and you fear he no longer
loves or desires you.

135
00:10:42,691 --> 00:10:43,991
How do you know?

136
00:11:12,021 --> 00:11:13,720
Remove your clothes.

137
00:11:18,260 --> 00:11:19,726
It is cold.

138
00:11:20,462 --> 00:11:22,429
Then go back to your children.

139
00:11:23,365 --> 00:11:26,533
I do not want to be with my children.

140
00:12:50,303 --> 00:12:52,990
__

141
00:13:25,589 --> 00:13:26,589
There.

142
00:13:28,458 --> 00:13:29,691
It is done.

143
00:13:31,261 --> 00:13:32,527
I am glad.

144
00:13:34,431 --> 00:13:35,697
I love you.

145
00:13:44,441 --> 00:13:45,874
Do you love me?

146
00:13:50,681 --> 00:13:52,247
Yes, I love you.

147
00:14:10,067 --> 00:14:12,001
What will King Ecbert do to me?

148
00:14:12,002 --> 00:14:14,035
He will do nothing to you,

149
00:14:14,371 --> 00:14:17,238
so long as I protect you
and Ragnar protects me.

150
00:14:19,676 --> 00:14:24,013
Ecbert must hide his power behind
a legitimate heir to the throne of Mercia.

151
00:14:24,014 --> 00:14:25,880
Then he will not have me killed.

152
00:14:26,483 --> 00:14:27,483
No,

153
00:14:28,185 --> 00:14:29,785
he will not have you killed.

154
00:14:29,786 --> 00:14:33,689
Burgred, you and I will be joint
rulers to the throne of Mercia.

155
00:14:33,690 --> 00:14:35,223
Does that not excite you, hmm?

156
00:14:35,876 --> 00:14:37,860
The Mercians may quarrel against us.

157
00:14:37,861 --> 00:14:39,427
No, they will not.

158
00:14:40,197 --> 00:14:43,848
Behind us are the iron fists of
both Wessex and the Northmen.

159
00:14:44,401 --> 00:14:45,500
Do you see?

160
00:14:46,086 --> 00:14:48,586
Then we will be prisoners
of Ecbert and Ragnar.

161
00:14:50,941 --> 00:14:52,140
I suppose.

162
00:14:53,343 --> 00:14:55,510
But better prisoners than dead, hmm?

163
00:14:56,697 --> 00:14:58,513
Prisoners can always escape.

164
00:15:21,605 --> 00:15:23,121
It is not his fault.

165
00:15:26,677 --> 00:15:28,109
No, you are right.

166
00:15:29,846 --> 00:15:31,096
It is someone else's fault.

167
00:15:31,415 --> 00:15:32,415
Who's that?

168
00:15:32,883 --> 00:15:35,283
Is it not clear to you, Bjorn Ironside?

169
00:15:37,387 --> 00:15:39,854
Who brought the Christ god
into our lives?

170
00:15:40,724 --> 00:15:42,958
Floki says we have betrayed our gods

171
00:15:42,959 --> 00:15:46,010
to serve a Christian king
and a Christian god.

172
00:15:47,347 --> 00:15:51,900
Unlike Floki, I do not think
I can speak for the gods.

173
00:15:54,571 --> 00:15:57,089
All I know is that my
desires and ambitions

174
00:15:57,090 --> 00:15:59,808
for our people have never changed.

175
00:16:00,660 --> 00:16:02,210
And now that I am King,

176
00:16:03,246 --> 00:16:05,013
I must try to bring them about.

177
00:16:07,250 --> 00:16:11,019
What limits did Odin
put upon his curiosity?

178
00:16:11,555 --> 00:16:13,672
- Who can say?
- Exactly.

179
00:16:13,673 --> 00:16:16,358
So unless I seek out those limits,

180
00:16:16,359 --> 00:16:19,027
I cannot say that I
have honored his spirit.

181
00:16:19,596 --> 00:16:21,630
Floki threatens me with Odin,

182
00:16:21,631 --> 00:16:25,266
but I would not be ashamed
to meet the god face-to-face.

183
00:16:31,742 --> 00:16:35,911
When Ragnar returns,
I am sure he will stay but a short time

184
00:16:35,912 --> 00:16:37,779
before sailing back home.

185
00:16:39,349 --> 00:16:41,816
He is, after all, a king.

186
00:16:43,420 --> 00:16:44,886
But you could stay.

187
00:16:46,523 --> 00:16:48,240
To what purpose, King Ecbert?

188
00:16:48,241 --> 00:16:49,424
Well, surely,

189
00:16:50,189 --> 00:16:54,829
someone must stay to make sure that
the new settlement is successful,

190
00:16:56,016 --> 00:16:58,399
the first harvest safely gathered.

191
00:16:59,069 --> 00:17:00,753
Someone will stay to do that.

192
00:17:00,754 --> 00:17:04,739
But even if I am not a king,
I am an earl.

193
00:17:06,092 --> 00:17:08,444
I must return to look after my people.

194
00:17:08,445 --> 00:17:12,298
It is fine and it is good
to talk of responsibilities,

195
00:17:12,299 --> 00:17:15,717
but there are other things in life.

196
00:17:17,154 --> 00:17:20,555
What if I asked you personally to stay?

197
00:17:22,058 --> 00:17:24,159
I have enjoyed your company.

198
00:17:24,778 --> 00:17:26,361
And the sex.

199
00:17:34,888 --> 00:17:36,137
Even so,

200
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:40,325
although you have made me
happy and fulfilled,

201
00:17:41,812 --> 00:17:43,946
I have come to understand that

202
00:17:43,947 --> 00:17:47,048
the only person you truly care for

203
00:17:47,984 --> 00:17:48,984
is yourself.

204
00:17:52,766 --> 00:17:55,579
__

205
00:18:06,870 --> 00:18:08,253
Forgive me, Earl Kalf.

206
00:18:09,222 --> 00:18:11,673
There is something we
must earnestly consider.

207
00:18:17,948 --> 00:18:22,500
And what must I so earnestly consider?

208
00:18:24,304 --> 00:18:26,839
At some point, if she still lives,

209
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:28,958
Lagertha will return from the raid.

210
00:18:28,959 --> 00:18:31,827
And she will bring with her
most of our young warriors,

211
00:18:31,828 --> 00:18:33,162
hardened by battle,

212
00:18:33,163 --> 00:18:35,697
perhaps enriched by spoils.

213
00:18:36,466 --> 00:18:38,967
And, I assume, loyal to her.

214
00:18:40,871 --> 00:18:44,205
Do you really suppose that
I have not considered that?

215
00:18:44,674 --> 00:18:46,675
Do you really think, poor Einar,

216
00:18:46,676 --> 00:18:48,243
that I have not prepared for that?

217
00:18:49,646 --> 00:18:52,046
I have invited someone here to join us.

218
00:18:52,682 --> 00:18:55,934
A very significant person indeed.

219
00:18:57,137 --> 00:19:00,471
And he will arrive here very soon.

220
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:05,894
Very soon.

221
00:19:08,005 --> 00:19:10,337
__

222
00:19:14,367 --> 00:19:15,800
What are you two whispering about?

223
00:19:17,837 --> 00:19:19,087
Where is our mother?

224
00:19:22,175 --> 00:19:24,342
Your mother goes to Harbard

225
00:19:24,677 --> 00:19:26,444
because of your brother Ivar.

226
00:19:26,746 --> 00:19:29,147
Ivar needs your mother more than you do,

227
00:19:29,849 --> 00:19:31,783
and Harbard helps her to look after him.

228
00:19:32,952 --> 00:19:34,520
Someday, Ubbe, you will understand

229
00:19:34,521 --> 00:19:37,221
what a mother has to
sacrifice for her children.

230
00:19:49,285 --> 00:19:50,301
Let's go.

231
00:19:53,807 --> 00:19:54,872
Where are you going?

232
00:19:58,278 --> 00:19:59,577
They'll be all right.

233
00:20:01,981 --> 00:20:03,781
Where are Ubbe and Hvitserk?

234
00:20:05,135 --> 00:20:06,135
They went out.

235
00:20:08,655 --> 00:20:10,688
I don't know why I feel frightened.

236
00:20:12,358 --> 00:20:13,825
I have to find them.

237
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,601
Hey, Ivar.

238
00:21:06,779 --> 00:21:08,147
Ubbe!

239
00:21:08,148 --> 00:21:09,463
Hvitserk!

240
00:21:11,518 --> 00:21:12,518
Stop!

241
00:21:17,373 --> 00:21:18,373
Stop!

242
00:21:20,627 --> 00:21:21,642
Ubbe, stop.

243
00:21:39,913 --> 00:21:40,913
Ubbe.

244
00:21:42,148 --> 00:21:43,281
Hvitserk, stop!

245
00:24:40,856 --> 00:24:42,157
Father.

246
00:24:42,158 --> 00:24:44,174
My son.

247
00:24:46,395 --> 00:24:48,862
No father could be prouder.

248
00:24:51,534 --> 00:24:56,304
Your wife has missed you
beyond endurance.

249
00:24:56,305 --> 00:24:58,590
I have often come across her
in the chapel,

250
00:24:58,591 --> 00:25:03,894
weeping and privately praying to God
for your safe and sure return.

251
00:25:05,064 --> 00:25:06,064
Judith.

252
00:25:14,690 --> 00:25:15,790
Princess.

253
00:25:15,791 --> 00:25:16,840
Ah, come.

254
00:25:18,794 --> 00:25:19,794
Sire.

255
00:25:22,131 --> 00:25:24,683
Sire, this is my young brother, Burgred.

256
00:25:24,684 --> 00:25:27,635
He says that the campaign
against us was no fault of his.

257
00:25:27,970 --> 00:25:29,970
Well, I am glad to hear it.

258
00:25:31,474 --> 00:25:33,507
Welcome, Burgred, to Wessex.

259
00:25:35,561 --> 00:25:40,981
Sire, my sister has told me you are
a most generous and forgiving monarch.

260
00:25:42,218 --> 00:25:44,269
I throw myself completely at your mercy.

261
00:25:44,270 --> 00:25:45,552
No, no, no.

262
00:25:46,188 --> 00:25:49,423
I meant what I said.
You are most welcome.

263
00:25:50,726 --> 00:25:55,897
Please join us to feast and
celebrate the happy future of Mercia.

264
00:25:55,898 --> 00:25:58,699
You see, I told you. Come, come.

265
00:26:07,877 --> 00:26:09,777
Ragnar Lothbrok.

266
00:26:13,466 --> 00:26:15,984
Forgive me if I do not kiss your hand.

267
00:26:15,985 --> 00:26:18,053
I would not expect it from you.

268
00:26:18,054 --> 00:26:22,322
As I've told you before,
we are equals, you and I.

269
00:26:22,825 --> 00:26:25,559
How is the, uh, settlement?

270
00:26:26,295 --> 00:26:29,329
Well, if you want to know
the answer to that question,

271
00:26:29,532 --> 00:26:32,332
you had better ask Earl Ingstad.

272
00:26:36,939 --> 00:26:37,939
You're wounded.

273
00:26:37,940 --> 00:26:38,940
Ah, yes.

274
00:26:39,375 --> 00:26:40,375
But...

275
00:26:41,544 --> 00:26:45,179
But Princess Kwenthrith
gave me some of her medicine.

276
00:26:49,952 --> 00:26:51,251
How is the settlement?

277
00:26:53,606 --> 00:26:57,024
It's working.
We have planted the first crop.

278
00:26:57,293 --> 00:26:59,094
King Ecbert gave us a new plow,

279
00:26:59,095 --> 00:27:02,129
and always assured us of his protection.

280
00:27:05,017 --> 00:27:06,266
And you believed him?

281
00:27:07,703 --> 00:27:08,736
Yes.

282
00:27:10,306 --> 00:27:13,073
So it seems you two got on well, then.

283
00:27:14,427 --> 00:27:15,427
Yes.

284
00:27:16,278 --> 00:27:18,278
For the sake of all of us.

285
00:27:19,665 --> 00:27:20,665
Ah.

286
00:27:22,051 --> 00:27:25,819
So you sacrificed yourself
for the common good.

287
00:27:26,122 --> 00:27:27,122
Mmm.

288
00:27:28,641 --> 00:27:31,358
As did you, Ragnar.

289
00:27:35,064 --> 00:27:36,330
I'm hungry.

290
00:27:41,370 --> 00:27:43,070
Hello, brother.

291
00:27:45,724 --> 00:27:46,840
I don't like you.

292
00:28:03,659 --> 00:28:04,659
Porunn.

293
00:28:10,432 --> 00:28:11,665
Hello, Bjorn.

294
00:28:14,870 --> 00:28:16,603
Are you enjoying yourself?

295
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:19,439
There must be a feast.

296
00:28:24,213 --> 00:28:26,146
Why don't you talk to me?

297
00:28:31,253 --> 00:28:32,386
Poor Bjorn.

298
00:28:33,589 --> 00:28:36,589
You won't want to marry me now,
will you?

299
00:28:37,893 --> 00:28:39,092
Don't say that.

300
00:28:59,815 --> 00:29:00,815
Athelstan.

301
00:29:01,550 --> 00:29:03,600
My friend.

302
00:29:07,256 --> 00:29:10,224
The battle for Mercia is won.

303
00:29:10,643 --> 00:29:15,880
But not yet the settlement.
Stay. Stay, both of you.

304
00:29:15,881 --> 00:29:17,898
Oversee your future.

305
00:29:18,284 --> 00:29:19,934
What could be more important?

306
00:29:19,935 --> 00:29:22,002
I have told you my decision.

307
00:29:25,007 --> 00:29:27,040
Perhaps Athelstan will stay.

308
00:29:28,093 --> 00:29:29,093
Will you?

309
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:32,112
I'm not sure.

310
00:29:32,781 --> 00:29:34,632
I've not discussed it with Ragnar.

311
00:29:34,633 --> 00:29:37,117
Hmm, or with Judith.

312
00:29:39,288 --> 00:29:42,356
My daughter-in-law
has grown fond of you.

313
00:29:43,058 --> 00:29:45,025
I know it. She has told me.

314
00:29:45,694 --> 00:29:48,996
She sometimes uses you as a confessor.

315
00:29:50,432 --> 00:29:53,333
If you go, she will miss you.

316
00:29:54,837 --> 00:29:56,436
As indeed will I.

317
00:30:13,772 --> 00:30:15,455
They are trying to make you stay?

318
00:30:18,093 --> 00:30:19,126
Yes.

319
00:30:22,665 --> 00:30:25,148
There is something
between you and that girl?

320
00:30:27,870 --> 00:30:28,870
Yes.

321
00:30:30,639 --> 00:30:32,356
You don't understand.

322
00:30:33,776 --> 00:30:35,642
Nobody understands.

323
00:30:42,735 --> 00:30:45,319
We're all free to do as we please.

324
00:30:46,605 --> 00:30:48,990
Are we still talking about women?

325
00:30:48,991 --> 00:30:50,257
Mmm.

326
00:31:02,871 --> 00:31:05,288
They say you will go home with Ragnar.

327
00:31:10,679 --> 00:31:12,263
Your husband is back.

328
00:31:12,264 --> 00:31:14,047
I gave myself to you.

329
00:31:16,018 --> 00:31:17,467
Please don't leave me.

330
00:31:33,445 --> 00:31:35,262
What will you do with Mercia?

331
00:31:35,797 --> 00:31:40,200
I will crown Kwenthrith and her
brother Burgred as joint rulers.

332
00:31:40,969 --> 00:31:42,303
That makes sense.

333
00:31:42,304 --> 00:31:45,338
You see how they feel for one another.
Why choose between them?

334
00:31:46,441 --> 00:31:48,308
They will not rule in any case.

335
00:31:50,879 --> 00:31:53,381
Then who will, Ragnar Lothbrok?

336
00:31:53,382 --> 00:31:54,382
You will.

337
00:31:55,484 --> 00:31:57,584
For you have given them the crown.

338
00:31:59,021 --> 00:32:04,024
Well, the important thing for me is that
there will be stability in the region.

339
00:32:06,461 --> 00:32:10,697
The important thing for you is that
Wessex will have power in Mercia.

340
00:32:13,735 --> 00:32:17,304
Actually, the really important
thing for me

341
00:32:17,873 --> 00:32:20,424
is that your settlement is a success.

342
00:32:20,425 --> 00:32:22,443
You've helped me in my
conquest for Mercia,

343
00:32:22,444 --> 00:32:25,279
and I've helped you to
establish a settlement

344
00:32:25,280 --> 00:32:27,815
in the very heart of my kingdom.

345
00:32:27,816 --> 00:32:31,685
If you remember, it was one of the
first things we ever talked about.

346
00:32:32,087 --> 00:32:33,753
I remember it very well.

347
00:32:35,657 --> 00:32:36,790
You and I,

348
00:32:38,560 --> 00:32:40,293
we understand each other.

349
00:32:41,613 --> 00:32:46,232
That is why we are allies,
and will remain so.

350
00:32:55,610 --> 00:32:58,011
Do you think you're a good man?

351
00:33:01,283 --> 00:33:02,283
Yes.

352
00:33:03,352 --> 00:33:04,584
I think so.

353
00:33:07,889 --> 00:33:09,689
Are you a good man?

354
00:33:12,978 --> 00:33:13,978
Yes.

355
00:33:16,598 --> 00:33:17,731
I think so.

356
00:33:22,804 --> 00:33:24,320
Are you corrupt?

357
00:33:27,576 --> 00:33:28,842
Oh, yes.

358
00:33:31,346 --> 00:33:32,812
- Are you?
- Mmm-hmm.

359
00:33:39,888 --> 00:33:40,888
Floki?

360
00:33:44,843 --> 00:33:46,459
What are you doing out here?

361
00:33:48,630 --> 00:33:50,497
I came to talk to the gods.

362
00:33:52,884 --> 00:33:54,601
They are angry, Rollo.

363
00:33:58,924 --> 00:34:02,442
And I'm so afraid that we must one day
choose between them

364
00:34:03,512 --> 00:34:04,844
and your brother.

365
00:34:07,015 --> 00:34:09,082
For me, it will never come to that.

366
00:34:25,734 --> 00:34:27,203
So...

367
00:34:28,228 --> 00:34:32,552
once again, Athelstan,
you have to make a choice.

368
00:34:34,109 --> 00:34:38,879
Will you go back with Ragnar Lothbrok
or will you stay with us?

369
00:34:38,880 --> 00:34:40,447
I have made up my mind.

370
00:34:42,184 --> 00:34:44,050
I will go back with Ragnar.

371
00:34:46,354 --> 00:34:48,521
All my future lies with Ragnar.

372
00:34:51,493 --> 00:34:55,228
I think that is the wrong decision.

373
00:34:59,084 --> 00:35:01,584
So, you left your earldom.

374
00:35:05,190 --> 00:35:07,090
Are you not afraid?

375
00:35:09,311 --> 00:35:12,679
No, I have a good man
who looks after it for me.

376
00:35:14,499 --> 00:35:16,015
Why should I be afraid?

377
00:35:19,621 --> 00:35:21,421
All men are ambitious.

378
00:35:23,258 --> 00:35:24,258
Not Kalf.

379
00:35:30,682 --> 00:35:32,432
Earl Kalf.

380
00:35:37,322 --> 00:35:38,538
Earl Kalf.

381
00:35:41,092 --> 00:35:43,209
- Earl Kalf!
- Mmm...

382
00:35:44,446 --> 00:35:45,845
What is it?

383
00:35:46,515 --> 00:35:47,981
Your guests have arrived.

384
00:36:09,004 --> 00:36:11,170
Erlendur, son of Horik.

385
00:36:12,424 --> 00:36:14,841
How gladly we welcome you to our hall.

386
00:36:16,011 --> 00:36:19,312
How impatiently
I have awaited your coming.

387
00:36:19,514 --> 00:36:22,099
I'm most grateful
for your invitation, Earl Kalf.

388
00:36:22,100 --> 00:36:26,520
I believe with all my heart that
you and I are natural allies.

389
00:36:26,521 --> 00:36:29,857
Yes! Against the Lothbroks
and all their kith and kin.

390
00:36:29,858 --> 00:36:32,275
And we have another natural ally.

391
00:36:33,411 --> 00:36:37,196
You may recall that Ragnar
blood eagled his enemy, Jarl Borg.

392
00:36:37,866 --> 00:36:40,416
But he forgot to kill Jarl Borg's wife,

393
00:36:40,702 --> 00:36:42,669
who subsequently gave birth to a son,

394
00:36:43,204 --> 00:36:45,038
and who is now my wife.

395
00:36:45,707 --> 00:36:47,123
Come, Torvi.

396
00:36:53,798 --> 00:36:55,882
Good day to you, Earl Kalf.

397
00:36:56,635 --> 00:36:58,217
Good day to you, Torvi.

398
00:36:58,553 --> 00:37:00,219
And to your son,

399
00:37:01,389 --> 00:37:04,190
the legitimate heir of
the great Jarl Borg.

400
00:37:08,752 --> 00:37:11,890
My dear brother, my dear Burgred,

401
00:37:12,774 --> 00:37:15,908
before all these people,
before King Ecbert of Wessex,

402
00:37:16,461 --> 00:37:19,579
King Ragnar
and King Aelle of Northumbria,

403
00:37:20,815 --> 00:37:24,150
let me say that I have
made peace with my past.

404
00:37:25,253 --> 00:37:26,986
I have come to terms with my family,

405
00:37:27,455 --> 00:37:29,455
with all the violence visited upon me.

406
00:37:31,476 --> 00:37:34,060
And now at last I am free from my anger,

407
00:37:35,029 --> 00:37:36,596
saved from my nightmares.

408
00:37:39,517 --> 00:37:41,434
And, finally, I know who I am.

409
00:37:43,605 --> 00:37:45,221
And so, my dear,

410
00:37:46,341 --> 00:37:48,024
let us celebrate our alliance,

411
00:37:49,978 --> 00:37:52,912
and drink to victory over my abusers.

412
00:37:54,349 --> 00:37:58,184
My dear sister, you have saved me.

413
00:37:59,487 --> 00:38:00,903
I love you.

414
00:38:04,525 --> 00:38:06,125
How I've always loved you.

415
00:38:09,697 --> 00:38:10,697
Yes.

416
00:38:13,101 --> 00:38:14,667
Salutations, my love.

417
00:38:39,661 --> 00:38:40,777
Burgred!

418
00:39:33,915 --> 00:39:36,349
My lords, ladies and gentlemen,

419
00:39:36,985 --> 00:39:42,588
please rise and raise your cups
to the sole and only ruler of Mercia.

420
00:39:51,699 --> 00:39:53,299
To the Queen of Mercia.

421
00:39:55,036 --> 00:39:56,268
To the Queen.

422
00:39:57,705 --> 00:39:58,938
To the Queen.

423
00:40:21,600 --> 00:40:24,580
__

424
00:40:37,945 --> 00:40:39,345
Why so quiet?

425
00:40:40,598 --> 00:40:42,181
Nothing to talk about?

426
00:40:43,751 --> 00:40:45,318
Not with you, perhaps.

427
00:40:46,921 --> 00:40:48,687
So you are tired of me already?

428
00:40:50,625 --> 00:40:53,959
Not to worry.
It is time for me to be on my way.

429
00:40:56,064 --> 00:40:58,197
I am never anywhere too long.

430
00:41:00,735 --> 00:41:02,034
I'm too restless.

431
00:41:08,576 --> 00:41:10,176
The boy is well.

432
00:41:13,214 --> 00:41:16,615
In future, I doubt he will
suffer such pains as before.

433
00:41:18,386 --> 00:41:20,686
I've taken some of
his pains upon myself.

434
00:41:24,459 --> 00:41:27,059
And your friend Siggy,
she's also very happy.

435
00:41:27,628 --> 00:41:31,263
She's with her husband,
sons, daughter in Valhalla.

436
00:41:33,201 --> 00:41:36,185
If you don't believe me,
you could ask the Seer.

437
00:41:39,407 --> 00:41:40,773
Farewell then.

438
00:41:43,694 --> 00:41:45,111
Who are you?

439
00:41:51,752 --> 00:41:53,419
Just a wanderer.

440
00:42:26,385 --> 00:42:29,561
