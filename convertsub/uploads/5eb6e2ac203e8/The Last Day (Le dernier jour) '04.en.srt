1
00:00:41,808 --> 00:00:49,510
THE LAST DAY

2
00:04:41,648 --> 00:04:42,740
Pardon me?

3
00:04:43,116 --> 00:04:43,980
Got a cigarette?

4
00:04:44,517 --> 00:04:45,506
Sure.

5
00:04:46,085 --> 00:04:47,484
I forgot mine.

6
00:04:48,421 --> 00:04:49,410
Thanks.

7
00:05:24,123 --> 00:05:25,217
Well...

8
00:05:25,425 --> 00:05:26,517
goodnight.

9
00:05:27,527 --> 00:05:28,551
Goodnight.

10
00:07:41,995 --> 00:07:44,820
Seems to be lifting,
could've eaten outside.

11
00:07:45,565 --> 00:07:47,890
- It's freezing.
- Thinks it's July.

12
00:07:48,201 --> 00:07:49,225
Simon called.

13
00:07:50,403 --> 00:07:51,233
What time?

14
00:07:51,838 --> 00:07:52,702
About 9:30.

15
00:07:52,872 --> 00:07:53,770
Could've told me.

16
00:07:53,940 --> 00:07:55,237
I am telling you.

17
00:07:56,209 --> 00:07:57,733
Mister was awake, so he called.

18
00:07:58,478 --> 00:08:00,878
That phone in the corridor's a pain.

19
00:08:01,214 --> 00:08:02,738
I've said that for years.

20
00:08:03,382 --> 00:08:05,213
- When does he arrive?
- Doesn't know.

21
00:08:05,718 --> 00:08:08,380
Today, tomorrow. The usual mystery.

22
00:08:08,821 --> 00:08:10,880
- He has work to do.
- Like to see it.

23
00:08:11,024 --> 00:08:11,952
So would I.

24
00:08:12,001 --> 00:08:13,383
Try his studio.

25
00:08:13,459 --> 00:08:15,254
It's full of roaches.
Thanks.

26
00:08:17,530 --> 00:08:20,522
- Ever seen his work?
- Call that work?

27
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:22,691
I call it hot air, not a livelihood.

28
00:08:25,438 --> 00:08:26,632
Never begs from you.

29
00:08:26,806 --> 00:08:28,933
No, like yourself, he'd die first.

30
00:08:33,079 --> 00:08:34,539
Don't start again.

31
00:08:34,747 --> 00:08:36,715
Think I'm a fool?

32
00:08:38,584 --> 00:08:40,211
I know you're paying his way,

33
00:08:40,386 --> 00:08:42,411
when he could easily get a job.

34
00:08:42,588 --> 00:08:45,523
But I'm too dumb
to understand his "work".

35
00:08:45,791 --> 00:08:49,022
You don't understand because
you won't try to.

36
00:08:49,195 --> 00:08:51,260
You won't suffer, so you do nothing.

37
00:08:51,964 --> 00:08:52,760
Your plates...

38
00:09:26,432 --> 00:09:27,626
In we go...

39
00:09:28,501 --> 00:09:29,695
Come along.

40
00:09:34,073 --> 00:09:36,564
Leave your stuff, I'll prepare the room.

41
00:09:39,612 --> 00:09:41,375
Sleeping in the same room?

42
00:09:44,050 --> 00:09:45,449
I dunno.

43
00:09:46,352 --> 00:09:47,649
Well, work it out.

44
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:48,912
Hungry?

45
00:09:49,322 --> 00:09:50,289
Yes.

46
00:10:04,003 --> 00:10:05,994
You sleep naked or in a T-shirt?

47
00:10:06,772 --> 00:10:07,761
In a T-shirt.

48
00:10:16,482 --> 00:10:17,676
What's that smell?

49
00:10:18,718 --> 00:10:20,743
I love it, it's so evocative.

50
00:10:23,689 --> 00:10:25,054
Maybe the wood.

51
00:10:25,391 --> 00:10:26,517
Can you help?

52
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:28,759
Who's that in the photo?

53
00:10:29,862 --> 00:10:31,955
- Which one?
- The big one.

54
00:10:32,565 --> 00:10:34,465
- Me.
- The state of you!

55
00:10:35,001 --> 00:10:36,127
The hair and all...

56
00:10:36,469 --> 00:10:38,699
- My Jim Morrison look.
- A bit off!

57
00:10:39,939 --> 00:10:40,667
Gonna help?

58
00:10:45,745 --> 00:10:47,474
Who's he? Is that you?

59
00:10:51,517 --> 00:10:53,041
No, that's...

60
00:10:53,586 --> 00:10:55,019
my brother.

61
00:10:55,955 --> 00:10:58,150
He died before I was born.

62
00:11:01,427 --> 00:11:02,724
Careful, it's hot!

63
00:11:03,629 --> 00:11:05,654
- Garlic?
- I knew you were coming.

64
00:11:05,831 --> 00:11:07,355
Not true.

65
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:09,864
- Says who?
- She was waiting by the phone.

66
00:11:10,703 --> 00:11:11,863
Not at all.

67
00:11:12,038 --> 00:11:14,131
Maybe I call every day unknown to you.

68
00:11:14,473 --> 00:11:16,031
- Off we go!
- Alice...

69
00:11:16,208 --> 00:11:18,574
He calls on the sly, he ghosts around,

70
00:11:18,744 --> 00:11:21,941
travels by UFO, and may be
a real-estate king!

71
00:11:22,515 --> 00:11:24,380
Sorry, I don't feel well.

72
00:11:24,850 --> 00:11:26,784
What's up? Can I get you something?

73
00:11:26,952 --> 00:11:28,544
An anxiety attack.

74
00:11:29,055 --> 00:11:30,989
I think I'll turn in.

75
00:11:31,224 --> 00:11:33,314
See you tomorrow.

76
00:11:49,342 --> 00:11:51,242
- It's delicious.
- Not overdone?

77
00:11:51,310 --> 00:11:52,722
It's missing something.

78
00:11:52,750 --> 00:11:54,203
Yes, a bit bland...

79
00:11:54,308 --> 00:11:55,509
Ever the kind word.

80
00:11:55,548 --> 00:11:57,609
Never know who we might hurt.

81
00:11:57,783 --> 00:11:59,683
- Or be hurt by.
- Meaning who?

82
00:11:59,886 --> 00:12:01,781
- Feel under attack?
- Not at all.

83
00:12:01,854 --> 00:12:03,512
You don't show it.

84
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:06,521
- A madhouse.
- Simon told me.

85
00:12:08,161 --> 00:12:09,287
What are you studying?

86
00:12:10,163 --> 00:12:11,858
Studying? Like Simon.

87
00:12:12,565 --> 00:12:13,361
Meaning?

88
00:12:13,966 --> 00:12:16,298
Exactly the same thing.

89
00:12:16,469 --> 00:12:21,133
Not exactly. In first year
you don't do natural drawing.

90
00:12:21,407 --> 00:12:22,669
What's life drawing?

91
00:12:24,610 --> 00:12:28,376
You have to draw a model
who poses on a podium...

92
00:12:29,515 --> 00:12:32,013
for 10, 15, 30 minutes...

93
00:12:32,785 --> 00:12:34,912
sometimes just 10 seconds
to capture the...

94
00:12:35,254 --> 00:12:37,518
- And who poses?
- Who poses?

95
00:12:38,791 --> 00:12:42,591
It depends... Kind of odd-looking girls,

96
00:12:42,762 --> 00:12:44,627
not too pretty, kind of plump.

97
00:12:45,398 --> 00:12:46,922
A bit like you, in fact.

98
00:12:47,266 --> 00:12:49,234
You could do it, hear it pays well.

99
00:12:53,206 --> 00:12:54,935
I met Mathieu the other day.

100
00:12:55,842 --> 00:12:57,222
Told him I was coming?

101
00:12:57,310 --> 00:12:58,340
Of course.

102
00:13:23,836 --> 00:13:25,861
Is this clean or dirty?

103
00:13:26,706 --> 00:13:27,502
Let's see.

104
00:13:28,741 --> 00:13:30,504
- Clean.
- You sure?

105
00:13:31,344 --> 00:13:33,835
Yeah. Leave it, I'll do it.

106
00:13:37,283 --> 00:13:38,648
Fuck!

107
00:13:40,052 --> 00:13:40,780
What's up?

108
00:13:40,953 --> 00:13:42,511
Dammit!

109
00:13:42,688 --> 00:13:43,882
Fucking thing!

110
00:13:54,734 --> 00:13:56,793
I rinsed in cold water.

111
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:06,671
- How old are you?
- 17. And you?

112
00:14:06,946 --> 00:14:09,005
- 18.
- Wouldn't think it.

113
00:14:16,556 --> 00:14:18,285
Got some underwear?

114
00:14:18,457 --> 00:14:20,652
I can't wear these for ever.

115
00:15:18,604 --> 00:15:19,412
Simon!

116
00:15:19,485 --> 00:15:21,414
Ask your sister to go along.

117
00:15:26,559 --> 00:15:28,026
- Want to come?
- Where?

118
00:15:28,328 --> 00:15:30,653
- To the pub.
- To do what?

119
00:15:30,763 --> 00:15:32,487
To do what...

120
00:15:32,598 --> 00:15:34,823
To dance, have a laugh,

121
00:15:35,001 --> 00:15:37,731
fool around, get drunk, snort coke...

122
00:15:37,903 --> 00:15:40,098
- You're off your tree.
- Well, have fun.

123
00:17:02,254 --> 00:17:04,654
Can you wait a sec? I want to pee.

124
00:17:04,724 --> 00:17:06,052
Keep an eye.

125
00:17:06,726 --> 00:17:07,784
Thanks.

126
00:17:27,747 --> 00:17:30,072
- Got a Kleenex?
- No.

127
00:18:15,027 --> 00:18:16,518
Wait here, I won't be long.

128
00:20:00,899 --> 00:20:02,432
Are you kidding me?

129
00:20:02,668 --> 00:20:04,860
I've been waiting half an hour.

130
00:20:06,872 --> 00:20:08,062
This is Mathieu...

131
00:20:09,007 --> 00:20:09,799
Louise.

132
00:20:10,375 --> 00:20:11,734
Hello.

133
00:20:12,411 --> 00:20:14,338
Can we go? I'm sick of this.

134
00:22:55,274 --> 00:22:56,866
Coming for a walk?

135
00:22:57,176 --> 00:22:58,006
I dunno.

136
00:22:58,177 --> 00:23:00,202
A bit of sea air...

137
00:23:00,546 --> 00:23:02,309
Do you good, you're so pale.

138
00:23:06,552 --> 00:23:07,985
Have I a spot there?

139
00:23:09,621 --> 00:23:11,282
Looks like a spider bite.

140
00:23:11,857 --> 00:23:13,791
All across your shoulders!

141
00:23:15,527 --> 00:23:16,555
Hold on.

142
00:23:20,265 --> 00:23:21,527
What're you doing?

143
00:23:21,700 --> 00:23:23,759
It stings, but it'll cure it.

144
00:23:25,003 --> 00:23:26,300
Where's my raincoat?

145
00:23:26,638 --> 00:23:27,832
In the barn.

146
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:30,833
Will she ever learn to shut a door?

147
00:23:31,009 --> 00:23:32,806
And he to shut his mouth?

148
00:23:32,978 --> 00:23:34,070
Where are you going?

149
00:23:34,246 --> 00:23:36,646
To join Dad on the boat.

150
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:39,274
What boat?

151
00:23:39,618 --> 00:23:41,609
Your Dad and Gérard bought a boat.

152
00:23:41,820 --> 00:23:44,846
They already decided last year.
Now it's done.

153
00:23:47,793 --> 00:23:50,125
- He never told me.
- You've just arrived.

154
00:23:53,866 --> 00:23:55,333
Seen the mood he's in?

155
00:23:56,034 --> 00:23:57,695
That's how he is.

156
00:23:58,604 --> 00:24:00,936
He's not like that with everyone.

157
00:24:01,874 --> 00:24:03,808
With Alice, it's different...

158
00:24:04,710 --> 00:24:07,144
Yeah, so maybe if I attempted suicide...

159
00:24:07,312 --> 00:24:09,337
Simon, don't start!

160
00:24:10,149 --> 00:24:11,377
I'm not starting.

161
00:24:14,052 --> 00:24:15,781
You've got your Mommy.

162
00:24:17,890 --> 00:24:19,983
Your darling Mommy.

163
00:24:20,392 --> 00:24:22,189
Lay off, Mom, I'm 20 years old.

164
00:24:22,427 --> 00:24:23,359
18.

165
00:24:23,695 --> 00:24:24,821
Same thing.

166
00:24:24,997 --> 00:24:26,396
Same thing...

167
00:24:30,636 --> 00:24:34,072
Until we have kids,
parents just don't get it.

168
00:24:48,887 --> 00:24:50,013
Where are you now?

169
00:25:35,801 --> 00:25:36,995
The bar?

170
00:25:37,169 --> 00:25:38,727
End of the corridor.

171
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:42,771
Le Grand Large Hotel.

172
00:26:06,198 --> 00:26:06,926
Marc...

173
00:26:08,767 --> 00:26:09,859
Marie...

174
00:26:14,373 --> 00:26:15,499
No kiss?

175
00:26:19,544 --> 00:26:20,841
Have a seat.

176
00:26:23,048 --> 00:26:24,913
- Didn't think you'd come.
- Nor I.

177
00:26:27,953 --> 00:26:28,779
Whisky?

178
00:26:28,887 --> 00:26:30,079
No. Yes...

179
00:26:52,811 --> 00:26:55,006
- How do you find me?
- Changed.

180
00:26:55,347 --> 00:26:57,372
A lot or a little?

181
00:26:57,549 --> 00:26:59,039
I don't know...

182
00:27:00,319 --> 00:27:02,014
You haven't really changed.

183
00:27:05,223 --> 00:27:06,554
I want you in my arms.

184
00:27:10,028 --> 00:27:11,359
It's true.

185
00:27:11,463 --> 00:27:12,760
Silly fool.

186
00:27:14,933 --> 00:27:16,560
I mean it.

187
00:27:19,404 --> 00:27:20,371
So?

188
00:27:21,373 --> 00:27:22,806
- What, so?
- What's going on?

189
00:27:23,075 --> 00:27:25,202
Nothing. Nothing special.

190
00:27:25,510 --> 00:27:26,408
No...

191
00:27:27,112 --> 00:27:30,275
You pop up after 20 years
and all is normal.

192
00:27:32,184 --> 00:27:34,152
You thought we'd just fuck?

193
00:27:34,486 --> 00:27:36,215
I didn't think anything...

194
00:27:36,988 --> 00:27:38,080
All and nothing.

195
00:27:38,557 --> 00:27:40,525
You speak like you write, well.

196
00:27:41,893 --> 00:27:43,019
So they say...

197
00:27:45,497 --> 00:27:47,488
I just felt like seeing you,

198
00:27:47,833 --> 00:27:50,028
for a little while, just like that.

199
00:27:51,136 --> 00:27:52,330
For no reason?

200
00:28:02,447 --> 00:28:03,277
Sit down.

201
00:28:04,149 --> 00:28:06,379
We can't see each other, ever again.

202
00:28:08,453 --> 00:28:09,417
I have to go.

203
00:28:14,626 --> 00:28:16,560
Don't ever call my place.

204
00:28:20,665 --> 00:28:21,632
I'll call you.

205
00:32:21,673 --> 00:32:22,833
You okay?

206
00:32:23,174 --> 00:32:24,198
Fine.

207
00:32:41,793 --> 00:32:43,420
I'll take a shower.

208
00:32:52,771 --> 00:32:54,204
By the way...

209
00:32:55,340 --> 00:32:57,433
I bumped into Mathieu.

210
00:32:59,844 --> 00:33:00,742
At Chassiron...

211
00:33:06,151 --> 00:33:07,482
He's teaching me to ride.

212
00:33:09,688 --> 00:33:11,280
Neat, eh?

213
00:33:11,923 --> 00:33:12,855
Yeah.

214
00:33:19,931 --> 00:33:21,558
Any plans for tonight?

215
00:33:24,435 --> 00:33:27,363
Because... Mathieu asked us round
to the lighthouse.

216
00:33:30,208 --> 00:33:31,539
Want to?

217
00:33:31,610 --> 00:33:33,641
No, you go ahead.

218
00:33:34,412 --> 00:33:36,175
I won't go without you.

219
00:33:36,848 --> 00:33:38,611
I don't feel like going out.

220
00:35:25,423 --> 00:35:27,288
Now we all kiss!

221
00:35:44,743 --> 00:35:45,702
Now you two!

222
00:35:48,346 --> 00:35:50,876
You can do better! A big French kiss!

223
00:35:51,016 --> 00:35:52,674
Come on!

224
00:36:01,559 --> 00:36:02,548
Bravo!

225
00:36:47,738 --> 00:36:49,863
- Where are you going?
- With Bérénice.

226
00:36:49,907 --> 00:36:51,468
Her folks rented a villa in Biarritz.

227
00:36:52,542 --> 00:36:53,702
You're so lucky!

228
00:36:53,877 --> 00:36:56,175
Yeah, they invited me,
as a birthday gift.

229
00:36:56,647 --> 00:36:57,939
Some gift.

230
00:36:58,282 --> 00:37:00,316
Not something you'd know about.

231
00:37:01,885 --> 00:37:03,880
No, I frequent the wrong people.

232
00:37:04,021 --> 00:37:05,708
My friends are broke, their parents too.

233
00:37:06,056 --> 00:37:09,619
But they're great fun,
that's their gift to me.

234
00:37:09,793 --> 00:37:11,693
Imagine if you'd have to say thank you.

235
00:37:12,346 --> 00:37:14,091
Wise up, will you?

236
00:37:14,144 --> 00:37:16,951
Holidaying with folks
always has its price.

237
00:37:17,201 --> 00:37:18,627
Not at all.

238
00:37:18,703 --> 00:37:23,599
Sure, last summer you said
what a bore her mother was.

239
00:37:24,121 --> 00:37:27,246
Unlike some, I like to please,
not just myself!

240
00:37:27,301 --> 00:37:28,305
To please?

241
00:37:28,779 --> 00:37:30,504
So you suck off her father on the sly?

242
00:37:31,281 --> 00:37:32,970
That's enough!

243
00:38:39,950 --> 00:38:43,181
Saw an article last year
on your exhibition.

244
00:38:44,655 --> 00:38:46,350
I was real proud.

245
00:38:47,891 --> 00:38:49,586
There were two photos you'd done.

246
00:38:50,594 --> 00:38:53,324
But badly printed, all blurred.

247
00:38:54,465 --> 00:38:57,866
They'd framed one across the forehead.

248
00:38:58,335 --> 00:39:00,303
A kid at an airport, I think.

249
00:39:05,309 --> 00:39:07,573
Don't you find something's changed?

250
00:39:08,545 --> 00:39:09,637
Where?

251
00:39:10,180 --> 00:39:11,147
Between us.

252
00:39:12,549 --> 00:39:14,107
It's odd seeing you again.

253
00:39:14,418 --> 00:39:15,476
Why?

254
00:39:18,122 --> 00:39:20,056
Here, under these conditions.

255
00:39:21,025 --> 00:39:23,016
I mean, with Louise and stuff.

256
00:39:23,961 --> 00:39:25,553
What's odd about it?

257
00:39:30,267 --> 00:39:31,666
It's not like before.

258
00:39:36,440 --> 00:39:39,500
A dead gull on the
balcony, it's all yucky.

259
00:40:09,540 --> 00:40:11,132
What's going on?

260
00:40:11,775 --> 00:40:13,333
I had a nightmare.

261
00:40:13,510 --> 00:40:14,602
Really?

262
00:40:17,748 --> 00:40:19,238
We were on this beach...

263
00:40:19,416 --> 00:40:21,077
No, don't tell.

264
00:40:27,491 --> 00:40:30,016
And it's so hot, with this T-shirt...

265
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:37,726
Not hot, you?

266
00:40:41,305 --> 00:40:42,465
What's up?

267
00:40:43,107 --> 00:40:45,075
I've a crick in my neck.

268
00:40:57,187 --> 00:40:58,518
Like a massage?

269
00:41:02,192 --> 00:41:03,159
Yeah.

270
00:41:48,172 --> 00:41:49,662
Where are your parents?

271
00:41:49,840 --> 00:41:51,137
In Paris.

272
00:41:56,213 --> 00:41:57,373
What do they do?

273
00:41:57,748 --> 00:41:59,147
They get by...

274
00:41:59,783 --> 00:42:02,308
My father writes, books and stuff.

275
00:42:02,786 --> 00:42:05,584
And my mother left a long time ago...

276
00:42:06,089 --> 00:42:08,284
upped and left, overnight.

277
00:42:08,592 --> 00:42:10,082
Without saying?

278
00:42:10,661 --> 00:42:11,821
Saying what?

279
00:42:35,419 --> 00:42:37,250
Why don't we make love?

280
00:42:41,859 --> 00:42:43,759
You prefer Mathieu, is that it?

281
00:48:35,079 --> 00:48:36,273
Not in bed?

282
00:48:37,948 --> 00:48:39,381
What're you doing?

283
00:48:39,550 --> 00:48:41,108
Taking a bath.

284
00:48:41,352 --> 00:48:43,650
- At two in the morning.
- Half-three.

285
00:48:44,488 --> 00:48:45,887
Who was there?

286
00:48:46,624 --> 00:48:48,114
Everyone, except you.

287
00:48:52,997 --> 00:48:55,557
Martine's going to La Rochelle tomorrow.

288
00:48:59,069 --> 00:49:01,537
If you want to go, she's leaving at 11.

289
00:49:02,573 --> 00:49:04,040
No way.

290
00:49:04,975 --> 00:49:06,408
- Sorry?
- Nothing.

291
00:49:08,012 --> 00:49:09,206
Who won?

292
00:49:09,380 --> 00:49:10,938
England, three nil.

293
00:49:11,649 --> 00:49:13,549
Could do with a TV here.

294
00:49:17,988 --> 00:49:19,979
- Thanks!
- What? Sorry.

295
00:50:12,209 --> 00:50:15,303
Who wants a hot chocolate?

296
00:51:34,124 --> 00:51:35,118
It's nothing...

297
00:51:35,259 --> 00:51:37,290
Nothing? Like to see you.

298
00:51:42,166 --> 00:51:44,794
You're pressing too hard. Let me try...

299
00:52:02,686 --> 00:52:04,119
Got a bandage?

300
00:52:04,788 --> 00:52:05,686
Yeah.

301
00:52:43,394 --> 00:52:44,854
Really suits you.

302
00:52:45,129 --> 00:52:46,455
Have a look.

303
00:52:47,097 --> 00:52:48,628
How does it feel?

304
00:52:49,066 --> 00:52:50,533
Isn't it a bit bridal?

305
00:52:50,601 --> 00:52:52,896
No, it never really was.

306
00:52:55,539 --> 00:52:56,972
It's nice and airy.

307
00:52:58,208 --> 00:53:00,030
But not exactly Christmas.

308
00:53:00,344 --> 00:53:01,770
That's the whole point.

309
00:53:05,448 --> 00:53:06,379
Don't like Christmas?

310
00:53:06,884 --> 00:53:08,715
Know anyone who does?

311
00:53:30,540 --> 00:53:31,871
What's this dress?

312
00:53:32,376 --> 00:53:33,773
Don't like it?

313
00:53:35,646 --> 00:53:37,641
Looks like a wedding dress.

314
00:53:37,848 --> 00:53:39,611
Your mother gave it to me.

315
00:53:40,184 --> 00:53:42,452
Said we've got to dress up.

316
00:54:10,247 --> 00:54:11,539
Look at me.

317
00:54:14,885 --> 00:54:16,079
Close your eyes.

318
00:54:35,138 --> 00:54:36,435
Okay.

319
00:54:46,650 --> 00:54:48,641
Hurry up, they're ready downstairs.

320
00:54:48,719 --> 00:54:50,514
The guests have arrived.

321
00:55:09,606 --> 00:55:11,506
I need a little room...

322
00:56:07,330 --> 00:56:09,298
They're here, but they don't go out.

323
00:56:09,633 --> 00:56:11,863
He's okay, but she's not well.

324
00:56:12,035 --> 00:56:13,627
She had breast cancer.

325
00:56:13,804 --> 00:56:14,964
Really? I didn't know.

326
00:56:15,138 --> 00:56:17,698
They removed the right breast.

327
00:56:29,386 --> 00:56:33,489
Dear friends, I propose
a toast to our new boat.

328
00:56:37,894 --> 00:56:40,124
A happy New Year to you all!

329
00:56:40,831 --> 00:56:42,157
Happy New Year!

330
00:56:45,302 --> 00:56:49,038
And to the future
young married couple!

331
00:57:02,753 --> 00:57:04,243
What are you making?

332
00:57:04,321 --> 00:57:05,786
Vodka and apple.

333
00:57:05,989 --> 00:57:07,581
Is it a nice mix?

334
00:57:08,459 --> 00:57:10,188
- A new cocktail?
- Taste.

335
00:57:12,463 --> 00:57:13,589
It's strong.

336
00:57:15,399 --> 00:57:16,661
Let me try again.

337
00:57:18,235 --> 00:57:19,600
Not bad.

338
00:57:21,405 --> 00:57:22,770
Want it?

339
00:57:25,576 --> 00:57:26,902
Damn!

340
00:57:27,545 --> 00:57:29,303
Broke my lipstick.

341
00:57:29,580 --> 00:57:30,979
Can I taste too?

342
00:57:33,984 --> 00:57:35,542
Smells like piss.

343
00:57:45,963 --> 00:57:47,294
Show me.

344
00:57:48,699 --> 00:57:50,496
It really suits you.

345
00:57:51,335 --> 00:57:52,825
Should wear it more often.

346
00:57:53,971 --> 00:57:55,268
Let's see again.

347
00:58:23,901 --> 00:58:25,459
Thought you weren't coming.

348
00:58:25,702 --> 00:58:27,329
I changed my mind.

349
00:58:28,372 --> 00:58:29,964
Good.

350
00:58:32,509 --> 00:58:34,670
Hi. Three beers, please.

351
00:58:37,648 --> 00:58:39,377
Is it a problem that I...

352
00:58:40,484 --> 00:58:42,042
get on well with her?

353
00:58:43,921 --> 00:58:45,013
You sure?

354
00:58:46,690 --> 00:58:47,850
I wouldn't want to...

355
00:58:48,025 --> 00:58:49,287
Don't worry.

356
00:58:53,063 --> 00:58:54,655
You know she's underage?

357
00:58:56,867 --> 00:58:59,062
Not that it'd bother you.

358
00:59:00,103 --> 00:59:02,503
On the contrary, no?

359
00:59:04,107 --> 00:59:05,074
Thanks.

360
00:59:18,589 --> 00:59:20,318
Doesn't suit you at all.

361
00:59:20,357 --> 00:59:21,524
What?

362
00:59:21,692 --> 00:59:23,683
All that gaudy make-up.

363
00:59:25,362 --> 00:59:27,689
I prefer you natural, without it.

364
00:59:34,137 --> 00:59:38,103
And those jingly bracelets
aren't too nice either.

365
00:59:40,444 --> 00:59:42,077
They look tarty.

366
00:59:45,048 --> 00:59:47,082
I think your eyes are wonderful,

367
00:59:48,151 --> 00:59:50,085
as if lit from within.

368
00:59:50,954 --> 00:59:52,581
Like a Breton lighthouse.

369
01:03:26,604 --> 01:03:28,696
How about a last drink?

370
01:03:30,407 --> 01:03:32,941
If you like... but I'm going to bed.

371
01:03:39,783 --> 01:03:41,844
Me too.

372
01:03:43,587 --> 01:03:44,976
Wait.

373
01:03:47,127 --> 01:03:49,049
Can I have a cigarette?

374
01:03:53,297 --> 01:03:55,164
I'll stay here a while.

375
01:04:28,764 --> 01:04:29,893
Mom...

376
01:04:38,408 --> 01:04:39,637
Mom...

377
01:04:43,247 --> 01:04:45,144
What time is it?

378
01:04:45,566 --> 01:04:47,513
What're you doing here?

379
01:04:49,987 --> 01:04:52,721
I wanted some air and I dozed off.

380
01:04:54,458 --> 01:04:56,325
Did you have fun?

381
01:05:09,940 --> 01:05:11,464
Goodnight.

382
01:16:58,147 --> 01:16:59,273
We said never again.

383
01:16:59,682 --> 01:17:01,545
You said never again.

384
01:17:02,085 --> 01:17:04,046
I said never again.

385
01:17:06,155 --> 01:17:07,520
Feel guilty?

386
01:17:09,125 --> 01:17:11,218
I would, if I were you.

387
01:17:11,394 --> 01:17:13,157
And you feel no guilt?

388
01:17:19,502 --> 01:17:21,026
I wish I'd never met you.

389
01:17:21,904 --> 01:17:23,030
I know.

390
01:17:28,077 --> 01:17:30,409
Why really did you return?

391
01:17:32,214 --> 01:17:33,272
For you.

392
01:17:33,382 --> 01:17:34,406
Liar.

393
01:17:35,952 --> 01:17:37,510
You want to see him.

394
01:17:38,921 --> 01:17:40,752
To get to know him, is that it?

395
01:17:42,425 --> 01:17:43,414
Yes.

396
01:17:46,362 --> 01:17:47,488
I'm not the only one.

397
01:18:22,064 --> 01:18:24,828
- Where'd you meet Simon?
- In school.

398
01:18:26,535 --> 01:18:28,628
Have to buy before you eat.

399
01:18:28,971 --> 01:18:30,165
2 kilos of grapes.

400
01:18:30,339 --> 01:18:31,601
Right away, Madam.

401
01:18:33,442 --> 01:18:35,205
Been together long?

402
01:18:35,378 --> 01:18:37,039
But we're not together.

403
01:18:38,514 --> 01:18:39,640
Not together?

404
01:18:40,282 --> 01:18:42,546
No, we're kind of friends...

405
01:18:44,120 --> 01:18:45,485
Like brother and sister?

406
01:18:47,957 --> 01:18:49,549
Will that be all?

407
01:18:50,459 --> 01:18:52,120
But you sleep together.

408
01:18:53,162 --> 01:18:55,153
Yes, but we're not together.

409
01:18:55,531 --> 01:18:57,158
Fancy some clementines?

410
01:18:57,333 --> 01:18:58,891
Ripe, or not?

411
01:18:59,268 --> 01:19:00,565
How much?

412
01:19:00,736 --> 01:19:02,431
Half?

413
01:19:03,706 --> 01:19:05,071
There you go...

414
01:19:05,574 --> 01:19:07,166
10 euros, bag included.

415
01:19:07,343 --> 01:19:08,503
Thank you.

416
01:19:08,677 --> 01:19:09,575
Have a nice day.

417
01:19:12,014 --> 01:19:13,276
Goodbye.

418
01:19:36,939 --> 01:19:38,606
Where's my black polo shirt?

419
01:19:39,508 --> 01:19:41,476
- In the cupboard.
- I just looked.

420
01:19:42,244 --> 01:19:43,609
Then, I don't know.

421
01:19:45,114 --> 01:19:47,009
Wherever you left it.

422
01:19:48,117 --> 01:19:49,648
Are you taking the piss?

423
01:19:50,720 --> 01:19:52,317
What's wrong?

424
01:19:55,291 --> 01:19:56,553
Are you crazy?

425
01:20:29,258 --> 01:20:30,520
What're you doing?

426
01:20:34,296 --> 01:20:35,661
What're you doing?

427
01:20:37,266 --> 01:20:38,494
See for yourself.

428
01:20:39,768 --> 01:20:41,395
What's all this carry on?

429
01:20:44,340 --> 01:20:45,534
I'm stifling...

430
01:20:46,775 --> 01:20:48,436
Or I'm bored, if you prefer.

431
01:20:52,448 --> 01:20:53,574
Where are you going?

432
01:20:54,049 --> 01:20:55,607
Suddenly interested?

433
01:20:58,087 --> 01:20:59,686
I'm going for a stroll,

434
01:21:00,222 --> 01:21:02,322
along the harbour.

435
01:21:02,925 --> 01:21:04,490
Don't you ever do that?

436
01:21:04,793 --> 01:21:06,727
Alone, at this hour, no.

437
01:21:07,129 --> 01:21:08,494
You're missing something.

438
01:21:10,199 --> 01:21:11,764
Maybe, but if you keep...

439
01:21:11,801 --> 01:21:13,591
Shut up! I'm dead tired of you!

440
01:21:20,676 --> 01:21:22,437
You don't even know why you came.

441
01:21:27,049 --> 01:21:28,741
Why are you here?

442
01:21:31,487 --> 01:21:33,487
- Let's swim.
- Don't be stupid.

443
01:21:33,789 --> 01:21:35,188
I said, let's swim.

444
01:21:35,227 --> 01:21:37,382
You're crazy, I have to go.

445
01:21:38,794 --> 01:21:40,356
What time is it?

446
01:21:41,097 --> 01:21:42,364
Marc, what time is it?

447
01:21:45,067 --> 01:21:46,632
Marc, stop!

448
01:21:48,504 --> 01:21:49,898
Answer, you scare me.

449
01:21:51,307 --> 01:21:52,797
Marc!

450
01:22:02,918 --> 01:22:04,545
Marie!

451
01:22:29,245 --> 01:22:30,978
You should've told him.

452
01:22:32,181 --> 01:22:34,272
The truth,

453
01:22:34,603 --> 01:22:36,441
from the very start.

454
01:22:37,386 --> 01:22:39,251
But I'm not letting you go.

455
01:22:39,322 --> 01:22:42,190
See? I'm holding
on and I won't let go.

456
01:22:46,595 --> 01:22:48,422
Your mom's buggered off...

457
01:22:50,082 --> 01:22:51,947
Don't know what's needling her.

458
01:22:52,118 --> 01:22:54,382
Always at a loose end, happy nowhere...

459
01:22:56,422 --> 01:22:57,946
I don't know.

460
01:22:58,124 --> 01:23:00,115
Must be the mid-life crisis.

461
01:23:07,767 --> 01:23:08,529
You okay?

462
01:23:09,268 --> 01:23:10,292
Yeah, okay.

463
01:23:11,320 --> 01:23:13,117
You haven't seen the boat yet.

464
01:23:16,525 --> 01:23:17,958
Tomorrow, if you want...

465
01:23:22,465 --> 01:23:24,296
And where's your fiancée?

466
01:23:25,334 --> 01:23:26,301
My fiancée?

467
01:23:26,469 --> 01:23:28,096
Louise.

468
01:23:29,172 --> 01:23:30,600
She's gone out.

469
01:23:30,740 --> 01:23:32,100
Without you?

470
01:23:32,975 --> 01:23:33,873
Yeah.

471
01:23:40,883 --> 01:23:42,441
I'm gonna get some sleep.

472
01:23:47,223 --> 01:23:49,088
Will I leave the door ajar?

473
01:23:49,425 --> 01:23:51,086
No, you can close it.

474
01:23:54,030 --> 01:23:55,224
Goodnight, son.

475
01:24:45,948 --> 01:24:47,040
Simon!

476
01:26:07,096 --> 01:26:08,791
Where were you? We looked all over.

477
01:26:11,567 --> 01:26:12,534
I'm talking to you.

478
01:26:13,736 --> 01:26:16,170
He bores you without me around, eh?

479
01:26:17,139 --> 01:26:18,538
Think I don't notice?

480
01:26:20,776 --> 01:26:22,175
I'm going, Simon.

481
01:26:22,645 --> 01:26:24,635
With Mathieu...

482
01:26:26,082 --> 01:26:28,714
North of Brittany, to Ile de Houat.

483
01:26:31,020 --> 01:26:32,687
I think I'm in love.

484
01:26:37,326 --> 01:26:38,390
And him?

485
01:26:39,295 --> 01:26:40,723
Him too.

486
01:26:42,765 --> 01:26:44,396
He'll come to Paris, which proves...

487
01:26:44,467 --> 01:26:47,335
Which proves you're totally naive.

488
01:26:49,138 --> 01:26:50,771
It proves nothing at all.

489
01:28:47,371 --> 01:28:48,668
I love you, Simon.

490
01:28:51,409 --> 01:28:53,707
You wait till you leave to say it?

491
01:28:58,516 --> 01:29:00,575
You love people on the way out?

492
01:29:06,390 --> 01:29:08,358
We can't love as we like...

493
01:29:09,894 --> 01:29:11,521
but differently.

494
01:29:14,298 --> 01:29:15,458
Yeah, sure.

495
01:29:25,376 --> 01:29:29,470
I left my address and
phone number in the drawer.

496
01:29:33,317 --> 01:29:34,614
Just go.

497
01:32:06,103 --> 01:32:08,765
Maybe we ought to leave tonight.

498
01:32:09,707 --> 01:32:11,365
One day more or less...

499
01:32:12,110 --> 01:32:13,434
Why?

500
01:32:14,579 --> 01:32:16,977
It's more quiet on the road.

501
01:32:20,184 --> 01:32:21,913
We need time to pack...

502
01:32:22,653 --> 01:32:24,450
It won't take long.

503
01:32:25,022 --> 01:32:27,115
I think Simon wants to stay
another week.

504
01:32:28,126 --> 01:32:32,453
Leave the boat in the harbour,
come back for the weekend.

505
01:32:34,599 --> 01:32:35,891
As you like...

506
01:33:19,644 --> 01:33:22,608
When your brother died,
your sister was two.

507
01:33:23,280 --> 01:33:24,804
I wanted another child,

508
01:33:26,016 --> 01:33:27,244
another boy...

509
01:33:28,953 --> 01:33:31,183
Not to replace him, Simon...

510
01:33:31,455 --> 01:33:34,353
You never did take
the place of the dead.

511
01:33:34,659 --> 01:33:36,187
It was to live...

512
01:33:36,394 --> 01:33:38,125
to go on with life.

513
01:33:43,034 --> 01:33:45,602
But your dad didn't want.

514
01:33:51,208 --> 01:33:52,470
So...

515
01:33:55,012 --> 01:33:56,911
I found one who did.

516
01:34:11,996 --> 01:34:15,996
He leaves Saturday from
the Grand Large Hotel.

517
01:34:17,068 --> 01:34:20,660
If you want to see him,
his name's Bromberg.

518
01:34:22,073 --> 01:34:23,562
Marc...

519
01:34:24,008 --> 01:34:25,605
Bromberg.

520
01:35:19,196 --> 01:35:21,887
That door needs repainting.

521
01:35:53,581 --> 01:35:55,548
- Good day.
- Good day.

522
01:35:55,983 --> 01:35:57,746
I'd like to see Mr Bromberg...

523
01:35:57,885 --> 01:35:58,613
Mister..?

524
01:35:59,603 --> 01:36:02,416
Bromberg, B-R-O-M-B-E-R-G.

525
01:36:08,329 --> 01:36:10,661
Sorry, he checked out this morning.

526
01:36:11,466 --> 01:36:12,364
Really?

527
01:36:16,270 --> 01:36:17,294
Thank you.

528
01:36:59,080 --> 01:37:01,541
Sorry, it's me again.

529
01:37:01,983 --> 01:37:04,008
What room was he in?

530
01:37:04,419 --> 01:37:06,416
I'll just check for you...

531
01:37:07,455 --> 01:37:08,717
Room 112.

532
01:37:14,428 --> 01:37:15,417
Thank you.

533
01:40:40,701 --> 01:40:42,032
Am I dead?

534
01:40:43,070 --> 01:40:44,970
Have I died or not?

535
01:40:46,240 --> 01:40:47,605
I don't care...

536
01:40:47,675 --> 01:40:49,766
Even if I am dead I'll return,

537
01:40:50,211 --> 01:40:52,101
next year...

538
01:40:52,346 --> 01:40:54,238
with my Mommy.

539
01:40:54,645 --> 01:40:57,315
We'll go for a drive and sing songs.
