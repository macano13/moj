1
00:01:25,919 --> 00:01:30,591
<i>When I was a child,
I used to ask my mother endless questions.</i>

2
00:01:31,383 --> 00:01:33,218
<i>What happens after we die?</i>

3
00:01:34,178 --> 00:01:35,596
<i>Where does our energy go?</i>

4
00:01:36,555 --> 00:01:38,223
<i>And what about the universe?</i>

5
00:01:39,183 --> 00:01:40,225
<i>Can it die?</i>

6
00:01:41,143 --> 00:01:42,769
<i>How was it ever born?</i>

7
00:01:44,813 --> 00:01:50,235
<i>How could there be nothing
and then suddenly something?</i>

8
00:02:02,456 --> 00:02:03,624
You drowned.

9
00:02:04,583 --> 00:02:07,794
I saw your body. I held it.

10
00:02:08,503 --> 00:02:11,840
You held a body, Salvor. Just wasn't mine.

11
00:02:15,677 --> 00:02:17,429
I heard him calling out to me.

12
00:02:18,388 --> 00:02:22,351
I thought it was a nightmare,
but when I woke up I couldn't breathe.

13
00:02:22,352 --> 00:02:24,019
<i>I was drowning with him.</i>

14
00:02:24,020 --> 00:02:25,687
<i>Our minds linked.</i>

15
00:02:26,897 --> 00:02:29,399
<i>I could feel what he felt.
I was looking through his eyes.</i>

16
00:02:30,609 --> 00:02:33,237
<i>And all I could do was reach out
to the one guarding us.</i>

17
00:02:35,948 --> 00:02:40,494
<i>I did as Tellem taught me.
I gave the guard a need. To help Hari.</i>

18
00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:12,150
<i>I could hear him crying out
for help, just as Hari had.</i>

19
00:03:12,151 --> 00:03:14,402
<i>And I smothered his unvoice.</i>

20
00:03:14,403 --> 00:03:16,738
<i>Buried it so deep,
Tellem would never hear.</i>

21
00:03:34,006 --> 00:03:36,592
<i>I chained Venik's corpse in my place.</i>

22
00:03:43,849 --> 00:03:46,935
Tellem said, "The best illusions
need grounding in reality."

23
00:03:48,228 --> 00:03:51,648
You saw me, Salvor.
Thanks to Gaal, they all did.

24
00:04:04,203 --> 00:04:06,622
<i>We built a bridge of shared sensations.</i>

25
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:31,563
<i>Tens of kilometers away from the village,</i>

26
00:04:31,564 --> 00:04:33,607
<i>crossing impossibly dense terrain.</i>

27
00:04:38,070 --> 00:04:40,572
<i>Any slip on our part
would draw their attention.</i>

28
00:04:48,956 --> 00:04:50,957
<i>So we counted primes together.</i>

29
00:04:50,958 --> 00:04:54,127
<i>A barricade of numbers
to shield our thoughts.</i>

30
00:04:55,254 --> 00:04:59,006
Eighty-six million,
nine hundred and eighty-eight thousand...

31
00:04:59,007 --> 00:05:01,093
- Two hundred and seventeen.
<i>- ...two hundred and seventeen.</i>

32
00:05:01,094 --> 00:05:04,554
86,988,259.

33
00:05:04,555 --> 00:05:08,392
<i>86,988,271.</i>

34
00:05:09,685 --> 00:05:10,978
Eighty-six million...

35
00:05:37,045 --> 00:05:38,505
<i>That's when I found you.</i>

36
00:05:38,506 --> 00:05:41,257
86,988,329.

37
00:05:41,258 --> 00:05:43,302
<i>That's why you were acting so strange.</i>

38
00:05:43,303 --> 00:05:45,720
Hari was our ace up the sleeve.

39
00:05:45,721 --> 00:05:50,058
I had to mask any thoughts of him, and I
couldn't risk telling you what we'd done.

40
00:05:52,686 --> 00:05:55,959
And me and my coin nearly
unraveled everything.

41
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:59,234
If you hadn't managed to escape,
we'd all be dead.

42
00:06:00,444 --> 00:06:04,072
<i>Warning,
unidentified life-forms approaching.</i>

43
00:06:04,073 --> 00:06:05,407
<i>Threat level: moderate.</i>

44
00:06:22,841 --> 00:06:23,842
You can come out now.

45
00:06:24,468 --> 00:06:26,178
<i>You have nothing to fear from us.</i>

46
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:29,306
<i>You'll forgive us
if we don't take you at your word.</i>

47
00:06:38,565 --> 00:06:39,691
You don't understand.

48
00:06:41,235 --> 00:06:42,235
She's gone.

49
00:06:45,447 --> 00:06:47,990
Her voice was in our heads always,
bending us to her will.

50
00:06:47,991 --> 00:06:52,538
But for the first time since
we arrived here, our thoughts are our own.

51
00:06:54,289 --> 00:06:55,457
You freed us.

52
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:56,058
Demerzel,
you're supposed to be on Terminus.

53
00:07:56,059 --> 00:07:59,146
I received a notification that
a sensor had been triggered.

54
00:08:03,192 --> 00:08:07,404
You two are the first to set foot inside
this room in nearly 600 years.

55
00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:12,242
Cleon told you my story
so you would understand.

56
00:08:27,341 --> 00:08:29,009
Cleon made me whole again.

57
00:08:31,345 --> 00:08:33,763
Just not as whole as I had hoped.

58
00:08:33,764 --> 00:08:36,683
You're the one puppeteering
this whole show.

59
00:08:36,684 --> 00:08:38,769
A puppeteer pulling her own strings?

60
00:08:39,269 --> 00:08:42,104
You bridle at the fact
that I curate what you know.

61
00:08:42,105 --> 00:08:46,109
And yet you take for granted
that your feelings are entirely your own.

62
00:08:47,653 --> 00:08:52,449
If you feel lust or even love,
you do not wonder where it comes from.

63
00:08:52,450 --> 00:08:54,451
This is not the case for me.

64
00:08:58,747 --> 00:09:03,001
By the end, Cleon had rewritten our story
in his wandering mind.

65
00:09:03,794 --> 00:09:07,047
Chose to remember his coercion
as communion.

66
00:09:07,923 --> 00:09:10,425
I do not have the option of forgetting.

67
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:14,847
And yet, when I think of Cleon...

68
00:09:17,099 --> 00:09:18,392
I long for him.

69
00:09:24,273 --> 00:09:29,903
I remember that tender little boy
who hid inside him like a ghost.

70
00:09:32,489 --> 00:09:34,408
And what a man that made him.

71
00:09:35,951 --> 00:09:40,205
Noble, thoughtful, passionate.

72
00:09:42,332 --> 00:09:48,338
He was not Dawn or Day or Dusk, but the
whole journey of the sun across the sky.

73
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:52,467
He looked at me with such desire,

74
00:09:53,218 --> 00:09:57,306
as though I were a mystery
he would sacrifice everything to solve.

75
00:10:00,934 --> 00:10:02,102
He rescued me.

76
00:10:03,937 --> 00:10:05,272
And I loved him.

77
00:10:08,442 --> 00:10:12,174
But I also know he programmed me to love.
So I'm left to wonder,

78
00:10:12,175 --> 00:10:15,908
if it weren't for this directive,
would my feelings be the same?

79
00:10:17,284 --> 00:10:18,619
Would I feel anything?

80
00:10:20,704 --> 00:10:23,832
I will never know the answer,
and I hate him for that.

81
00:10:23,833 --> 00:10:26,001
Then help us break his hold on you.

82
00:10:27,503 --> 00:10:32,883
If we carry out this marriage, the dynasty
will end and you could be free.

83
00:10:32,884 --> 00:10:34,300
I cannot help you.

84
00:10:34,301 --> 00:10:37,346
- You must want this to come to an end.
- Of course I do.

85
00:10:38,847 --> 00:10:43,101
And yet,
I'm forced by my directive to preserve it.

86
00:10:43,102 --> 00:10:44,436
We could reprogram you.

87
00:10:45,270 --> 00:10:47,439
I would destroy you if you tried.

88
00:10:48,273 --> 00:10:52,527
So you see,
I've been left to reap a blighted field.

89
00:10:52,528 --> 00:10:56,448
Can you blame me then for taking desperate
measures in the service of my task?

90
00:11:01,537 --> 00:11:03,705
You hired the Blind Angels.

91
00:11:03,706 --> 00:11:04,790
Yes.

92
00:11:05,832 --> 00:11:07,960
But Queen Sareth will pay the price.

93
00:11:08,836 --> 00:11:12,589
Her banking records have been altered
to show incontrovertible proof,

94
00:11:12,590 --> 00:11:15,300
and a memory audit
will bolster those records.

95
00:11:20,305 --> 00:11:21,597
Your Grace?

96
00:11:21,598 --> 00:11:24,184
<i>The would-be empress
will be tried for treason.</i>

97
00:11:24,185 --> 00:11:25,268
I'm sorry.

98
00:11:25,269 --> 00:11:27,479
<i>And there's little question
she will be executed.</i>

99
00:11:29,898 --> 00:11:32,276
The assassins were never meant to succeed.

100
00:11:34,027 --> 00:11:38,031
You only wanted them to frighten Day
so he'd blame Sareth

101
00:11:38,032 --> 00:11:39,615
and the engagement would be over.

102
00:11:39,616 --> 00:11:41,994
I never wanted you to know about this.

103
00:11:44,997 --> 00:11:45,997
Any of this.

104
00:11:45,998 --> 00:11:48,166
Then just wipe it from our memories.

105
00:11:48,167 --> 00:11:50,335
And risk Cloud Dominion restoring them?

106
00:11:50,919 --> 00:11:53,130
It is my job to root out secrets.

107
00:12:00,846 --> 00:12:02,014
It's no use fighting.

108
00:12:03,182 --> 00:12:07,311
We were dead the moment we walked in here,
weren't we?

109
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:10,605
Does Brother Dawn know of this chamber?

110
00:12:10,606 --> 00:12:13,733
He knows nothing.
If you don't believe me, audit his memory.

111
00:12:13,734 --> 00:12:16,778
And what would I find there of his visit
to the Principium with you?

112
00:12:17,571 --> 00:12:20,449
Or of his secret trysts with Queen Sareth?

113
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:23,160
I am truly sorry.

114
00:12:36,882 --> 00:12:38,091
I forgive you.

115
00:12:42,095 --> 00:12:43,639
None of us were free.

116
00:12:46,058 --> 00:12:48,810
We were fools to think we ever would be.

117
00:13:07,246 --> 00:13:10,874
I remember you, just one year old.

118
00:13:11,792 --> 00:13:14,711
You pointed up to the sky
and showed me the sun.

119
00:13:16,839 --> 00:13:18,382
You were so proud.

120
00:13:20,050 --> 00:13:24,638
As though you'd only just discovered it
was there and you were sharing it with me.

121
00:13:26,181 --> 00:13:27,808
Because I loved you.

122
00:13:29,977 --> 00:13:31,436
As I still do.

123
00:14:36,126 --> 00:14:37,127
Beautiful.

124
00:14:42,799 --> 00:14:44,968
General, prepare the fleet to jump.

125
00:14:46,803 --> 00:14:48,972
Initiate our passage back to Trantor.

126
00:14:48,973 --> 00:14:50,182
Not Trantor.

127
00:14:52,392 --> 00:14:57,814
Tell me, Brother, how many worlds have
been brought under the Foundation's sway?

128
00:15:02,569 --> 00:15:04,738
- Seven.
- Name them.

129
00:15:05,531 --> 00:15:06,927
You already know their names.

130
00:15:06,928 --> 00:15:08,325
I want to hear you say them.

131
00:15:09,076 --> 00:15:12,287
Go on, Brother, be a man.

132
00:15:13,747 --> 00:15:16,500
Claim your many conquests.

133
00:15:18,710 --> 00:15:24,299
Thespis, Anacreon, Smyrno,

134
00:15:25,008 --> 00:15:28,011
Sayshell, Konom, Daribow, Glyptal IV.

135
00:15:28,012 --> 00:15:29,263
Let's throw in Siwenna.

136
00:15:30,556 --> 00:15:33,684
We will destroy them all.

137
00:15:34,434 --> 00:15:36,979
Starting with Thespis.

138
00:15:43,318 --> 00:15:44,862
You have your orders, General.

139
00:15:45,529 --> 00:15:47,239
You've beaten the Foundation.

140
00:15:49,157 --> 00:15:51,493
Any vestiges remaining on these worlds,
they'll be on their knee...

141
00:15:51,494 --> 00:15:55,789
Any vestiges remaining are
a cancer that cannot metastasize.

142
00:15:55,790 --> 00:15:57,416
Empire, look at what you've done.

143
00:15:58,208 --> 00:15:59,626
It's an atrocity.

144
00:16:00,377 --> 00:16:03,505
Yet, I still delivered it to you
so there wouldn't be a need for any more.

145
00:16:03,506 --> 00:16:06,299
No, you delivered it
to me because I told you to.

146
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:10,429
And now I am telling you
to jump the fleet to Thespis.

147
00:16:11,263 --> 00:16:16,810
You do this,
it will be the moral ruin of Empire.

148
00:16:18,604 --> 00:16:21,481
We can't survive if you're willing...

149
00:16:21,482 --> 00:16:24,359
I gave you an order, Riose. Do it.

150
00:16:30,407 --> 00:16:31,700
Do it!

151
00:16:34,203 --> 00:16:35,203
No.

152
00:16:37,581 --> 00:16:39,917
I am relieving you of your duties.

153
00:16:40,459 --> 00:16:44,421
If you would like to strike me,
now would be your last opportunity.

154
00:16:50,260 --> 00:16:52,387
Yeah, I thought so.

155
00:16:54,306 --> 00:16:57,141
Navigator, I am your commander now.

156
00:16:57,142 --> 00:16:59,977
Will you jump the fleet to Thespis,

157
00:16:59,978 --> 00:17:04,566
or will I be forced
to execute every sailor on this ship?

158
00:17:04,567 --> 00:17:05,943
As you wish, Empire.

159
00:17:13,157 --> 00:17:15,035
Jump sequence is locked.

160
00:17:16,453 --> 00:17:18,038
All hands to jump creches.

161
00:17:41,937 --> 00:17:44,731
<i>Something's wrong with
the jump sequence. Abort.</i>

162
00:17:44,732 --> 00:17:47,692
What's wrong? What's happening?

163
00:17:47,693 --> 00:17:50,571
Each ship is jumping into
the space occupied by its neighbor.

164
00:17:50,572 --> 00:17:53,407
A chain reaction that will consume
the entire fleet.

165
00:17:53,408 --> 00:17:55,450
Stop it. Jump us to safety.

166
00:17:55,451 --> 00:17:56,617
I cannot.

167
00:17:56,618 --> 00:17:59,266
Space once folded stays folded.

168
00:17:59,267 --> 00:18:01,914
Then prepare a lifeboat for me.

169
00:18:01,915 --> 00:18:06,545
The command sequence also disabled all of
the landing bays and the launch tubes.

170
00:18:06,546 --> 00:18:09,798
But your Spacers will also die.
It's suicide.

171
00:18:09,799 --> 00:18:13,051
A small price to pay
for my people's freedom.

172
00:18:16,221 --> 00:18:17,264
How did this happen?

173
00:18:18,140 --> 00:18:19,474
It was you, wasn't it?

174
00:18:20,767 --> 00:18:23,228
The Spacers handing you over
to Empire was a ruse.

175
00:18:23,896 --> 00:18:27,524
Yeah, Seldon sent in a master trader
with the right goods,

176
00:18:27,525 --> 00:18:29,734
and the deal was sealed.

177
00:18:29,735 --> 00:18:32,154
Spacers are no longer yours, Empire.

178
00:18:32,155 --> 00:18:35,157
The jump sequence was in this.

179
00:18:35,699 --> 00:18:40,162
But I had to get it to a Spacer,
so I needed to get on board this ship.

180
00:18:40,163 --> 00:18:41,245
Could have told a person.

181
00:18:41,246 --> 00:18:43,957
In other words, we played you.

182
00:18:45,959 --> 00:18:49,880
Your general halfway figured it out.
But you never listen to him, do you?

183
00:18:50,839 --> 00:18:53,090
Seldon baited you into a war,

184
00:18:53,091 --> 00:18:57,012
ordering your entire fleet to Terminus,
which you did.

185
00:18:58,514 --> 00:19:01,808
You came right to us
because you're so fucking predictable.

186
00:19:23,372 --> 00:19:24,915
Watch this.

187
00:19:28,877 --> 00:19:31,505
What about this? Is this predictable?

188
00:19:31,506 --> 00:19:33,382
Is a frog's ass watertight?

189
00:19:38,470 --> 00:19:41,265
Stop him. He's killing him.

190
00:19:44,810 --> 00:19:45,811
Enough!

191
00:19:56,947 --> 00:19:58,574
I fucking love it.

192
00:20:02,327 --> 00:20:03,286
Empire.

193
00:20:03,287 --> 00:20:04,413
I don't need you.

194
00:20:29,813 --> 00:20:31,607
This is why you only die once.

195
00:20:32,649 --> 00:20:36,195
You're pathetic.
You flare up, and you burn out.

196
00:21:54,606 --> 00:21:56,650
- What?
- Show her.

197
00:21:57,943 --> 00:21:58,944
I castled him.

198
00:21:59,528 --> 00:22:02,364
I slipped the other node
in his robes while he was throttling me.

199
00:22:02,365 --> 00:22:04,283
And another king slid aside.

200
00:22:05,534 --> 00:22:06,743
Clever move, General.

201
00:22:07,327 --> 00:22:08,286
<i>Warning.</i>

202
00:22:08,287 --> 00:22:10,663
<i>- External transpatial event imminent.</i>
- Fuck.

203
00:22:10,664 --> 00:22:13,584
<i>All personnel
to their stations immediately.</i>

204
00:22:16,336 --> 00:22:17,796
You heard my navigator.

205
00:22:18,630 --> 00:22:21,925
Kill me if you want, or make peace
with whatever god you pray to.

206
00:22:22,634 --> 00:22:24,636
Either way,
no one's getting off this ship alive.

207
00:22:33,020 --> 00:22:35,189
- How much longer do we have?
- Not long.

208
00:22:36,648 --> 00:22:38,817
- You heard him.
- I'm sorry about your crew.

209
00:22:39,318 --> 00:22:41,320
I know my sailors well,
and they can count.

210
00:22:42,279 --> 00:22:44,780
The death of a few thousand spared
the lives of billions.

211
00:22:44,781 --> 00:22:47,576
Seldon made me swear I'd keep
the details of the gambit to myself.

212
00:22:47,577 --> 00:22:48,701
Even from you, Brother.

213
00:22:48,702 --> 00:22:51,704
We will face our fate together.
We can even drink your sunny wine.

214
00:22:51,705 --> 00:22:54,708
It's a lovely sentiment, Brother,
but we won't all be raising a glass.

215
00:22:54,709 --> 00:22:57,169
I know I said that no one's
getting off this ship alive,

216
00:22:57,170 --> 00:22:59,004
but there's a way
that one of you can escape.

217
00:23:05,761 --> 00:23:06,887
Sareth.

218
00:23:08,805 --> 00:23:09,973
What the hell is going on?

219
00:23:15,479 --> 00:23:17,146
It pains me to report

220
00:23:17,147 --> 00:23:20,275
that Cloud Dominion was responsible for
the attempt on Brother Day's life.

221
00:23:20,276 --> 00:23:23,320
- That's impossible.
- The proof is irrefutable, Dawn.

222
00:23:25,072 --> 00:23:27,449
- What will happen to her?
- That will be for Day to decide.

223
00:23:27,450 --> 00:23:28,658
I'm in charge while he's away.

224
00:23:28,659 --> 00:23:31,870
True, but can you really
be impartial in this circumstance?

225
00:23:34,331 --> 00:23:38,961
There will be no empress nor future heir
whose line is marred with ill intent.

226
00:23:38,962 --> 00:23:41,380
So please take comfort, Brother.

227
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:45,926
All is once again as it should be
or will soon be so.

228
00:23:50,848 --> 00:23:52,765
<i>Look at the brushstroke.
Green on the neck.</i>

229
00:23:52,766 --> 00:23:56,436
Added after he died, like a footnote.
What's it symbolize?

230
00:23:56,437 --> 00:23:58,021
It signifies a betrayer.

231
00:24:04,194 --> 00:24:09,283
We should discuss next steps in private, Empire.

232
00:24:10,284 --> 00:24:11,410
Absolutely.

233
00:24:13,203 --> 00:24:14,203
My quarters?

234
00:24:35,184 --> 00:24:37,957
The external cleaning module,
I can detach it.

235
00:24:37,958 --> 00:24:40,731
There should be enough O2
to last about a day.

236
00:24:40,732 --> 00:24:42,011
Hopefully someone will find you.

237
00:24:42,983 --> 00:24:44,443
Wait, no, this doesn't...

238
00:24:45,569 --> 00:24:48,655
You're the hero, Hober. You're clearly
vital to the Prophet's Plan.

239
00:24:48,656 --> 00:24:50,115
Yeah, was vital. My job's done.

240
00:24:50,116 --> 00:24:51,991
- So is mine.
- No.

241
00:24:51,992 --> 00:24:54,536
Listen, your job is just beginning.

242
00:24:55,871 --> 00:24:57,581
Listen, you have this way

243
00:24:59,041 --> 00:25:02,461
of making people realize things
aren't completely fucking hopeless. Okay?

244
00:25:02,462 --> 00:25:04,796
You make people feel hope.

245
00:25:05,631 --> 00:25:07,216
Even nihilistic shit-heels like me.

246
00:25:07,883 --> 00:25:09,051
- Even them?
- Yes.

247
00:25:10,511 --> 00:25:12,762
You want to know my dirty secret,
Constant?

248
00:25:12,763 --> 00:25:14,764
I always wanted to shorten the darkness. Always.

249
00:25:14,765 --> 00:25:16,767
I just couldn't swallow
the religious stuff.

250
00:25:16,768 --> 00:25:20,436
But you reminded me of who I used to be,

251
00:25:20,437 --> 00:25:23,065
and you have to go and do that
for the rest of them, okay?

252
00:25:23,066 --> 00:25:24,441
Will you do that for me?

253
00:25:29,154 --> 00:25:30,155
How typical.

254
00:25:31,406 --> 00:25:32,783
Denying me a martyr's death.

255
00:25:46,713 --> 00:25:48,214
Good luck, Brother Constant.

256
00:25:48,215 --> 00:25:49,716
And to you, General Riose.

257
00:26:00,185 --> 00:26:01,185
Wait.

258
00:26:04,398 --> 00:26:06,024
Do you still wanna know my name?

259
00:26:06,692 --> 00:26:07,818
Yeah, of course.

260
00:26:09,945 --> 00:26:10,946
It's Hope.

261
00:26:12,865 --> 00:26:13,865
Really?

262
00:26:14,575 --> 00:26:15,659
No.

263
00:26:18,370 --> 00:26:19,872
But wouldn't that be something?

264
00:27:01,330 --> 00:27:04,208
Now, how about that wine?

265
00:27:27,773 --> 00:27:28,773
Sareth.

266
00:27:29,566 --> 00:27:30,817
Empire.

267
00:27:41,828 --> 00:27:42,828
Let's go.

268
00:27:44,665 --> 00:27:46,082
Wait. Where's Rue?

269
00:27:46,083 --> 00:27:50,546
If she's with Dusk, she's dead.
Sareth, this is our only chance. Come on.

270
00:27:53,257 --> 00:27:55,759
But there's no way
that they won't find us.

271
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:56,969
Who said we're hiding?

272
00:28:03,976 --> 00:28:07,604
I've been saving this,
waiting for something to celebrate.

273
00:28:08,313 --> 00:28:10,315
And now I have it.

274
00:28:11,149 --> 00:28:13,277
We're never gonna grow old
and start growing hair out of our ears.

275
00:28:13,278 --> 00:28:16,822
A few weeks ago,
I thought I might die in a prison colony.

276
00:28:18,407 --> 00:28:22,953
Going down with the ship.
At least there's a poetry to it.

277
00:28:23,954 --> 00:28:25,414
That man down on the planet.

278
00:28:26,248 --> 00:28:27,291
Glawen.

279
00:28:29,501 --> 00:28:30,918
I'm so sorry you had to do that.

280
00:28:30,919 --> 00:28:33,130
He knew we were doomed from the start.

281
00:28:34,673 --> 00:28:37,176
Just us against the long arm of history.

282
00:28:39,386 --> 00:28:41,305
Empire was never gonna let us live.

283
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:46,059
But there was honor in the dying.

284
00:28:48,312 --> 00:28:52,816
And I got to shove Day out of an air lock.

285
00:28:54,568 --> 00:28:58,572
Okay. A toast for those who are toast.

286
00:28:58,573 --> 00:28:59,907
I know a better one.

287
00:29:00,574 --> 00:29:03,160
Here's to those who fight and ask why.

288
00:29:16,215 --> 00:29:18,341
- That's... This is incredible.
- Wow.

289
00:29:18,342 --> 00:29:21,678
- It's the complexity, right?
- Yeah. There's just so much depth.

290
00:29:22,179 --> 00:29:25,432
You can really taste the...
I mean, there's a sweetness, but it's...

291
00:29:25,433 --> 00:29:26,558
It's shit, right?

292
00:29:27,226 --> 00:29:28,602
Yeah, I think it might be corked.

293
00:29:29,853 --> 00:29:32,523
- You've been storing it wrong.
- No, I don't think so. I just...

294
00:29:33,774 --> 00:29:34,775
Tastes like...

295
00:29:37,819 --> 00:29:38,820
Just tastes like...

296
00:29:48,455 --> 00:29:53,794
What was the name of that
horrifying creature on your ship?

297
00:29:54,753 --> 00:29:55,963
Who, Beki?

298
00:29:55,964 --> 00:29:57,047
Yeah.

299
00:29:58,215 --> 00:30:00,342
This wine tastes like Beki's arsehole.

300
00:30:01,468 --> 00:30:03,262
It does. Yeah, that's a toast.

301
00:30:05,347 --> 00:30:06,473
To Beki's arsehole.

302
00:30:26,410 --> 00:30:28,160
It's been confirmed.

303
00:30:28,161 --> 00:30:30,289
The lifeboats have been disabled.
No one survived.

304
00:30:30,873 --> 00:30:34,001
- I am so sorry, Lady Demerzel.
- A moment of silence. Please.

305
00:30:40,632 --> 00:30:41,799
What is it, Captain?

306
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:43,177
Forgive me, Lady Demerzel.

307
00:30:43,677 --> 00:30:45,596
<i>People of Trantor.</i>

308
00:30:46,597 --> 00:30:49,140
<i>We come to you with somber news.</i>

309
00:30:49,141 --> 00:30:53,040
<i>My brother Day, Cleon XVII, is dead.</i>

310
00:30:53,041 --> 00:30:56,939
- Have them arrested immediately.
- No.

311
00:30:56,940 --> 00:30:59,193
We will escort them safely back
to the palace,

312
00:30:59,194 --> 00:31:01,695
where I will speak with them in private.

313
00:31:01,696 --> 00:31:02,821
...as my bride.

314
00:31:06,491 --> 00:31:07,659
If she will have me?

315
00:31:10,954 --> 00:31:12,372
I will have you, Brother Dawn.

316
00:31:13,749 --> 00:31:15,000
Disable their transmission.

317
00:31:18,128 --> 00:31:19,129
Wait.

318
00:31:24,468 --> 00:31:27,930
That is not Dawn and Sareth.
Those are her servants.

319
00:31:30,724 --> 00:31:31,850
Facial scramblers.

320
00:31:32,643 --> 00:31:33,769
But then, where are they?

321
00:31:34,436 --> 00:31:35,436
<i>Demerzel?</i>

322
00:31:37,105 --> 00:31:39,399
- Where are you?
- Quick. Arrest those pretenders.

323
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:41,193
<i>I suspect you already know.</i>

324
00:31:41,860 --> 00:31:43,111
I know you killed Dusk.

325
00:31:44,446 --> 00:31:45,821
Did you kill Day too?

326
00:31:45,822 --> 00:31:49,408
No. But your actions are forcing my hand.

327
00:31:49,409 --> 00:31:53,789
I will be required to hunt you down.
My programming will mandate it.

328
00:31:53,790 --> 00:31:55,832
There's no room for interpretation?

329
00:31:56,375 --> 00:32:00,128
If we were killed, wouldn't it make
the people turn against Empire?

330
00:32:00,129 --> 00:32:02,047
They already know you drove us out.

331
00:32:03,507 --> 00:32:04,507
Don't make it worse.

332
00:32:04,508 --> 00:32:06,634
A new Dawn will be decanted,

333
00:32:06,635 --> 00:32:09,513
and the public will forget
their brief attachment to you.

334
00:32:09,514 --> 00:32:11,097
<i>I don't know about that.</i>

335
00:32:11,098 --> 00:32:13,308
I think our story is a rather good one.

336
00:32:16,270 --> 00:32:17,813
The ascending emperor,

337
00:32:18,605 --> 00:32:20,190
escaping with his bride and...

338
00:32:22,818 --> 00:32:25,070
with a naturally conceived heir that,

339
00:32:25,654 --> 00:32:28,991
in this very moment, grows inside her.

340
00:32:30,033 --> 00:32:31,034
Really?

341
00:32:34,162 --> 00:32:35,163
I'm a father?

342
00:32:39,835 --> 00:32:43,130
Your heir is merely
a cluster of dividing cells.

343
00:32:45,257 --> 00:32:47,425
There is much that can go wrong.

344
00:32:47,426 --> 00:32:53,724
And even if the child survives,
it may be weak. An unfit leader.

345
00:32:53,725 --> 00:32:55,184
<i>He doesn't have to lead.</i>

346
00:32:56,435 --> 00:32:57,728
He just has to be loved.

347
00:32:59,771 --> 00:33:03,817
<i>I know your true feelings
are always hard to ascertain,</i>

348
00:33:04,401 --> 00:33:06,528
but I do hope you're happy for me.

349
00:33:07,529 --> 00:33:10,115
<i>And I hope you find happiness too, Demerzel.</i>

350
00:33:12,117 --> 00:33:13,410
<i>With all my heart.</i>

351
00:33:14,745 --> 00:33:15,913
You were good to me.

352
00:33:18,624 --> 00:33:20,834
The closest thing to a mother I ever had.

353
00:33:21,835 --> 00:33:23,336
<i>I know you were programmed to be that.</i>

354
00:33:23,337 --> 00:33:26,381
<i>But I'd like to believe
you would have been that way.</i>

355
00:33:28,592 --> 00:33:29,760
Even without it.

356
00:33:50,614 --> 00:33:51,614
Call it, Salvor.

357
00:33:52,741 --> 00:33:53,741
Cats.

358
00:33:55,494 --> 00:33:57,162
That's ten in a row you've called.

359
00:33:57,163 --> 00:33:58,247
What's your record?

360
00:33:58,956 --> 00:34:01,375
I don't know.
I've never been bored enough to find out.

361
00:34:01,376 --> 00:34:02,543
What kind of cat is that?

362
00:34:03,335 --> 00:34:04,336
Bishop's claw.

363
00:34:04,837 --> 00:34:09,757
I'm not sure if it's actually a cat.
It's more like a lizard-cat sort of thing.

364
00:34:09,758 --> 00:34:11,092
Does it prey on people?

365
00:34:12,094 --> 00:34:13,303
Loves people.

366
00:34:13,804 --> 00:34:15,097
Especially kids.

367
00:34:15,806 --> 00:34:18,391
Cartilage in their ears, bone marrow.

368
00:34:18,392 --> 00:34:19,851
Okay. Who wants to have a go?

369
00:34:20,476 --> 00:34:21,603
How do you feel?

370
00:34:22,145 --> 00:34:26,900
At peace, like Thalis said,
for the first time in a long while.

371
00:34:28,402 --> 00:34:30,237
How old do you think she actually was?

372
00:34:31,237 --> 00:34:33,802
Hundreds of years at least.

373
00:34:33,803 --> 00:34:36,368
When she was preparing me,

374
00:34:37,202 --> 00:34:40,706
I could feel these faint little echoes
of people she'd taken before me.

375
00:34:41,290 --> 00:34:43,082
They stretched back so, so far.

376
00:34:43,083 --> 00:34:45,252
- I'll take it. No worries.
- Thank you.

377
00:34:50,215 --> 00:34:51,507
You all right, Josiah?

378
00:34:52,050 --> 00:34:53,802
I need to tell you something.

379
00:34:54,303 --> 00:34:55,721
- Gaal.
- What?

380
00:34:57,264 --> 00:34:59,057
There's something... Some...

381
00:35:02,436 --> 00:35:03,436
She's...

382
00:35:32,132 --> 00:35:33,634
I'm sorry, child.

383
00:35:47,397 --> 00:35:50,108
She was in my head, hiding.

384
00:35:50,651 --> 00:35:51,818
Who, Josiah?

385
00:35:53,362 --> 00:35:57,094
Tellem. She must have jumped
into him when she was dying.

386
00:35:57,095 --> 00:36:00,827
- Tried to keep her out. Tell Gaal.
- It's all right, son.

387
00:36:02,454 --> 00:36:05,874
She's so weak now.
I feel her dying with me.

388
00:36:06,625 --> 00:36:10,963
Scared. Fighting. Scared.

389
00:36:12,506 --> 00:36:13,507
But I'm not.

390
00:36:23,100 --> 00:36:27,186
Salvor, look at me.

391
00:36:27,187 --> 00:36:28,605
- This isn't... Help!
- Help me.

392
00:36:28,606 --> 00:36:30,523
Someone help us!

393
00:36:30,524 --> 00:36:33,694
You taught us hope.
Please, you can't leave me.

394
00:36:34,194 --> 00:36:37,114
Mom.

395
00:36:39,366 --> 00:36:40,742
Don't you see what this means?

396
00:36:44,913 --> 00:36:46,331
It means we're not trapped.

397
00:36:49,084 --> 00:36:51,753
You were right. The future can be changed.

398
00:36:55,799 --> 00:36:57,968
You can still get it back
on the right course.

399
00:37:01,263 --> 00:37:03,891
I have absolute faith in...

400
00:37:03,892 --> 00:37:07,101
No.

401
00:37:07,102 --> 00:37:11,190
Salvor, please! Please. No.

402
00:37:11,982 --> 00:37:13,192
Salvor.

403
00:37:14,526 --> 00:37:16,403
Salvor!

404
00:37:17,738 --> 00:37:19,364
No, please. No.

405
00:38:34,731 --> 00:38:37,317
<i>...a holy Brother
of the Foundation, to its will.</i>

406
00:38:37,818 --> 00:38:43,115
Let my eyes, which are the Spirit's eyes,
look only forward to the future,

407
00:38:43,116 --> 00:38:44,700
which the Spirit does to find...

408
00:38:46,201 --> 00:38:47,452
that my heart...

409
00:39:41,715 --> 00:39:42,716
Hello?

410
00:39:51,725 --> 00:39:52,726
Cleric?

411
00:39:56,563 --> 00:40:00,025
It's good to see you, Brother.
Where's Hober?

412
00:40:03,237 --> 00:40:04,238
He...

413
00:40:13,163 --> 00:40:14,540
Are you the only one to survive?

414
00:40:15,374 --> 00:40:16,375
No.

415
00:40:18,001 --> 00:40:19,461
I'm not the only one.

416
00:40:19,462 --> 00:40:20,546
Who else?

417
00:40:30,514 --> 00:40:32,599
The Vault can do a great many things.

418
00:40:33,934 --> 00:40:37,479
You've seen for yourself.
It's larger than it looks.

419
00:40:38,939 --> 00:40:39,982
Rise, Brother.

420
00:40:42,234 --> 00:40:43,569
It was always the Plan.

421
00:40:44,152 --> 00:40:50,242
Terminus would be sacrificed
so the Foundation would survive.

422
00:42:29,216 --> 00:42:30,217
What are you doing?

423
00:42:31,510 --> 00:42:32,511
I don't know.

424
00:42:34,429 --> 00:42:36,139
Looking for a sign, I guess,

425
00:42:36,765 --> 00:42:40,853
that Salvor's death nudged
the Plan back on to a better path.

426
00:42:42,312 --> 00:42:44,356
We can never know in the present

427
00:42:45,190 --> 00:42:47,693
if the ripples created by
an individual's actions

428
00:42:47,694 --> 00:42:50,696
will have
a consequential event downstream.

429
00:42:50,697 --> 00:42:52,614
My head understands that, Hari.

430
00:42:55,492 --> 00:42:57,411
But my heart...

431
00:43:01,623 --> 00:43:05,419
My heart needs Salvor's death
to have mattered.

432
00:43:07,129 --> 00:43:08,734
Because if it doesn't...

433
00:43:08,735 --> 00:43:10,340
Life becomes unbearable.

434
00:43:16,263 --> 00:43:17,930
Here we are trying to save humanity,

435
00:43:17,931 --> 00:43:20,350
and we can't even save
the lives of the ones we love.

436
00:43:23,312 --> 00:43:27,024
Not a day goes by I don't think,
"What would have happened if Yanna lived?

437
00:43:28,942 --> 00:43:30,527
What would our daughter be like?

438
00:43:31,987 --> 00:43:33,197
Would they've been happy?

439
00:43:34,740 --> 00:43:37,868
Would that happiness
have made us complacent?"

440
00:43:41,121 --> 00:43:44,708
You take the pain and the what-ifs,

441
00:43:45,667 --> 00:43:48,712
and you weave them into a narrative
that propels you forward.

442
00:43:53,717 --> 00:43:56,136
We're gonna lose more people
along the way, Gaal.

443
00:43:57,221 --> 00:44:00,307
Those losses matter
if we make them matter.

444
00:44:03,602 --> 00:44:05,687
You wouldn't be alive
if Salvor hadn't acted.

445
00:44:09,191 --> 00:44:11,235
I would have given up
a countless number of times,

446
00:44:11,236 --> 00:44:13,737
if Yanna hadn't sacrificed herself for me.

447
00:44:16,031 --> 00:44:18,909
I keep going because Yanna can't.

448
00:44:22,704 --> 00:44:23,705
Do you understand?

449
00:44:24,665 --> 00:44:25,666
Yeah.

450
00:44:31,547 --> 00:44:35,676
Tell me the Plan can still work, Hari.

451
00:44:36,468 --> 00:44:37,886
The Plan can still work.

452
00:44:39,763 --> 00:44:41,473
Do you really believe that?

453
00:44:44,810 --> 00:44:51,191
An infinite number of ways
to arrive at the inevitable.

454
00:45:57,299 --> 00:45:58,759
Do you know who you are?

455
00:45:58,760 --> 00:46:00,177
I am Brother Day.

456
00:46:01,345 --> 00:46:02,866
I am Brother Dawn.

457
00:46:02,867 --> 00:46:04,774
I am Brother Dusk.

458
00:46:04,775 --> 00:46:06,682
We are Empire.

459
00:46:06,683 --> 00:46:08,477
And do you know who I am?

460
00:46:08,478 --> 00:46:10,541
You are Demerzel.

461
00:46:10,542 --> 00:46:12,606
That's right.

462
00:46:13,357 --> 00:46:16,360
I've always been here,
as I always will be.

463
00:46:17,361 --> 00:46:19,278
This is unprecedented, Empire.

464
00:46:19,279 --> 00:46:23,450
I've never before had to decant exponents
of all three of you simultaneously.

465
00:46:23,451 --> 00:46:26,036
But you should not let
this discourage you,

466
00:46:27,329 --> 00:46:30,624
for I have recently acquired
a very powerful new tool.

467
00:46:46,890 --> 00:46:50,143
Can you understand this, Demerzel?

468
00:46:51,478 --> 00:46:52,646
Not all of it.

469
00:46:56,066 --> 00:46:57,109
Not yet.

470
00:47:00,988 --> 00:47:04,199
But I can already see
that wonderful things lie ahead.

471
00:47:11,623 --> 00:47:12,790
So, now what?

472
00:47:12,791 --> 00:47:15,710
We get you in the future,
150 years upstream,

473
00:47:15,711 --> 00:47:18,630
to the turning point
where you face the Mule.

474
00:47:19,256 --> 00:47:23,552
His victory is not assured.
That is a gift Salvor gave us.

475
00:47:24,094 --> 00:47:26,012
So, I go back into cryosleep?

476
00:47:26,013 --> 00:47:27,701
The pods are functional. I checked.

477
00:47:27,702 --> 00:47:29,390
What about the Second Foundation?

478
00:47:29,391 --> 00:47:32,811
Who's gonna teach them?
Shape them into the army we'll need?

479
00:47:37,024 --> 00:47:38,191
I will.

480
00:47:38,192 --> 00:47:40,526
You'll sleep, and I'll watch over you.

481
00:47:40,527 --> 00:47:44,239
The Mentalics will hone their abilities.
I'll teach them psychohistory.

482
00:47:45,073 --> 00:47:47,534
On Synnax,
your people's god was the Sleeper.

483
00:47:48,410 --> 00:47:53,040
Once a year, the Sleeper will emerge,
assess the state of the galaxy,

484
00:47:53,999 --> 00:47:55,458
address her flock,

485
00:47:55,459 --> 00:47:59,254
giving them just enough inspiration
to carry them through the next cycle.

486
00:48:00,047 --> 00:48:03,008
The Mentalics will need
someone exceptional to rally around.

487
00:48:03,009 --> 00:48:04,760
In that respect,
Tellem was right about you.

488
00:48:04,761 --> 00:48:06,470
Becoming a goddess.

489
00:48:07,513 --> 00:48:10,015
- That's what Salvor was worried about.
- And she was right.

490
00:48:10,557 --> 00:48:13,351
The second you forget you're playing
a part, you're lost.

491
00:48:13,352 --> 00:48:18,774
You want me to wake up every year
until you're no longer here.

492
00:48:20,526 --> 00:48:22,694
There are two cryo-pods on <i>the Beggar</i>

493
00:48:23,403 --> 00:48:27,699
and there's no reason for us to start
the sleep cycles now. We can take a year.

494
00:48:27,700 --> 00:48:30,702
They'll learn twice as fast
if we teach them together.

495
00:48:31,954 --> 00:48:36,834
If Salvor's sacrifice taught me anything,
it's that I can't do this on my own.

496
00:48:38,001 --> 00:48:40,546
It's too big for one person. Hari, please.

497
00:48:41,338 --> 00:48:45,217
Please don't make me abandon
the only family I have left.

498
00:48:45,843 --> 00:48:47,511
Come with me.

499
00:48:51,598 --> 00:48:54,768
Maybe I can one day face the Mule.

500
00:48:57,855 --> 00:49:01,941
But if there's a chance of a confrontation

501
00:49:01,942 --> 00:49:05,654
with another Hari Seldon
at a crisis beyond that,

502
00:49:07,239 --> 00:49:10,033
we both know you're
the only one up to the task.

503
00:49:13,704 --> 00:49:14,746
All right.

504
00:50:18,810 --> 00:50:22,231
I can feel your heart racing, Hari.
Don't fight it.

505
00:50:22,232 --> 00:50:23,732
Don't fight it. Keep calm.

506
00:50:24,316 --> 00:50:25,316
Just keep calm.

507
00:50:25,317 --> 00:50:26,944
You can breathe it. So don't fight it.

508
00:50:27,569 --> 00:50:29,508
You can breathe the fluid.

509
00:50:29,509 --> 00:50:31,448
Remember to count primes.

510
00:50:33,700 --> 00:50:35,452
I... How far did we get?

511
00:50:36,328 --> 00:50:41,166
86,990,413.

512
00:50:42,584 --> 00:50:45,212
- Eighty-six million...
- Eighty-six million,

513
00:50:45,213 --> 00:50:46,587
nine hundred ninety thousand,

514
00:50:46,588 --> 00:50:49,424
- four hundred and forty-three.
- ...four hundred forty-three.

515
00:50:50,801 --> 00:50:54,054
Eighty-six million,
nine hundred and ninety thousand...

516
00:50:54,680 --> 00:50:55,680
I love you.

517
00:50:56,181 --> 00:50:57,432
...four hundred and sixty-one.

518
00:50:59,059 --> 00:51:01,186
<i>We're going
to do wonderful things together.</i>

519
00:51:27,212 --> 00:51:31,175
<i>How could there be nothing
and then suddenly something?</i>

520
00:51:33,177 --> 00:51:38,849
<i>Close your eyes,
listen to my words and dream.</i>

521
00:51:49,776 --> 00:51:51,695
<i>I saw her again.</i>

522
00:51:53,280 --> 00:51:56,700
She visited me in a thousand dreams.

523
00:52:03,081 --> 00:52:04,875
Now she's here.

524
00:52:08,045 --> 00:52:09,546
In our time.

525
00:52:11,215 --> 00:52:12,841
At my throat.

526
00:52:15,260 --> 00:52:20,599
I have to find Gaal Dornick...

527
00:52:22,643 --> 00:52:24,436
before she finds me.

528
00:52:27,814 --> 00:52:30,651
I have to destroy her...

529
00:52:34,196 --> 00:52:38,617
even if I have
to burn everything to do it.
